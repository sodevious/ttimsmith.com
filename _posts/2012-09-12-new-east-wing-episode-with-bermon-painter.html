<p>I had the honor of talking with <a href="http://bermonpainter.com/">Bermon Painter</a> who gave an excellent talk about CSS Pre-processors at <a href="http://frontenddesignconference.com/">The Front-End Conf</a>. He's a real cool and smart guy and the episode turned out to be really educational.</p>
