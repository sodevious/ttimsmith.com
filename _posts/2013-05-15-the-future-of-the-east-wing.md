On February 14th, 2012, I launched an online broadcast called The East Wing. A little over a year later, one of my favorite people, Dan Benjamin, has asked me to join his network.

 I've always had a thing for broadcasting. When I was a bit younger than I am now, I majored in Radio and Television before pursuing design. I love radio. I listened to my favorite shows religiously and I'd quote my favorite hosts throughout the day.

Anyway, this is all to say that The East Wing is so much more than a show for me. It's a labor of love that I pour my heart into every week. Now, I know I shouldn't give someone this much importance, but I can't tell you how great it felt to hear Dan say he wanted my show on his network.

Now, before I make a complete fool of myself, and sound like a complete fan boy, lets talk logistics.

### Will it Be the Same Show?

Nope. I'm in the process of turning into a complete jerk.

I'm totally kidding guys! Of course it'll be the same show. As always, you know that your pal, and we'll continue to have fun on the show, and have great conversations.

The theme music will be changing. I'm currently using a song that I can't obtain the appropriate license to use, so our first show on 5by5 will debut the new song. Let me know what you think.

### The East Wing Live!

Also, we'll be doing the show live now! I'm so extremely excited about that! Mark your calendars, the show will broadcast live every Tuesday at 3:30 CST.

You can listen to the show one of three ways:

+ **The 5by5 Website**   
This is the most obvious way, and available to most. You can find the live stream [here](#).

+ **The 5by5 Mac App**   
This is some filler text

+ **the 5by5 iOS App**   
This is more filler text.
