<p>This week: Adam is away with a sick household so Tim and Chris hold down the fort and talk through 30/30, a time management app, Google Reader’s imminent death, sidebars and blog design, Discovery asking for more money and is Orphan Black the best show on TV?</p>

<p>We’re taking a two week break, and we’ll be re-launching the show with an all new name, artwork, and more! Stay tuned!</p>
