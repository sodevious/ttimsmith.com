I wrote my first article on the Lullabot Blog! It's on Constructive Criticism. I find that this trend to publicly shame people about the work they're doing is wrong and isn't the way to make the web a better place. It's a quick read; something small you can digest during a break in your work day. Hope you enjoy!
