  <p>Freelancing is regarded as the holy grail in our industry. It’s something most people look to as a magical fantasy land where all dreams come true. However, being a freelancer can be very difficult if you don’t know much about the business of design.</p>

<p>About a month ago, my buddie Josh Long asked if anyone was interested in contributing to the Treehouse blog. Since I have a constant need to feel &amp; sound smart, I jumped at the chance! Today, my first article went live. I talk about some things I've picked up related to the business of design.</p>

<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
