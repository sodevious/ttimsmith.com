<p>This week, I had the pleasure of talking with Sam Kapila. Sam is a Designer and Educator, and from what I can tell, one of the first people to teach Responsive Web Design at a University level.</p>

<p>Now, I know that Responsive get's thrown around a lot as a buzz word, but Sam is working with <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a> and <a href="http://paravelinc.com/">Paravel</a> as her unofficial advisory board. It's great to see the support she's received in Austin for teaching her students the right stuff, and I had a blast talking with her.</p>
