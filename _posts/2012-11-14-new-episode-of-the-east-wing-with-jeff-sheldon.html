<p>I had the pleasure of having Jeff Sheldon on The East Wing this week. For those of you who don't know, Jeff Sheldon is the Founder of <a href="http://shop.ugmonk.com/">Ugmonk</a>. It was a lot of fun talking to him and seeing how much he's enjoying running Ugmonk. His story is an interesting one and he imparts some great advice.</p>
