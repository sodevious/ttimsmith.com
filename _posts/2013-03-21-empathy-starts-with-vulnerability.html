  <p>I’ve distanced myself from past projects; I’ve avoided pushing for the sort of work I really want; I’ve glossed over details to avoid admitting how little I actually know. I’ve worked hard, terribly hard, to make my checklist add up to a good job.</p>

<p>This is such a great thought on The Pastry Box Project by Sara Wachter-Boettcher. I just love her writing. Not to mention, it's incredibly helpful to see someone you admire have a lot of the same nervousness and insecurity with their work. It reminds us that we're all human, and that to a certain extent, we all feel we're figuring it out as we go.</p>
