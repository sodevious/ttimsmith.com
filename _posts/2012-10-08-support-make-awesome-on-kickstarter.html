<p>I'm so excited to announce that we launched the Kickstarter campaign for <a href="http://makeaweso.me">Make Awesome</a> today! I've shot and reshot the video tons of times and finally I had to just be happy with it. I've been doing a lot of behind the scenes work and I'm anxious to see if people believe in the idea as much as I do.</p>

<p>At the moment, we already have some amazing contributors like <a href="https://twitter.com/higley">John Higley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Eecho13084">Abby Barlok</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Spentacular">Spencer Hamm</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jglovier">Joel Glovier</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/eaton">Jeff Eaton</a> and more to come. Like I've said before, we've confirmed three of four interviews with <a href="http://twitter.com/_jannalynn">Janna Hagan</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/vic_bell">Vic Bell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/samsoffes">Sam Soffes</a>.</p>
