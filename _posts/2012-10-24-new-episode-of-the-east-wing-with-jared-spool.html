<p>I had the great pleasure of recording an episode with <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool">Jared Spool</a> about a week ago. He's such a nice guy. Turns out, he's an avid listener of the show! We got the chance to talk about how he thought the internet was a fad, all the work that goes into putting on a conference and much more.</p>
