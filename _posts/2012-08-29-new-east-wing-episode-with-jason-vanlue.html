<p>I had the awesome pleasure of talking with Jason VanLue for an hour. In case you don't know, he's the Design Lead at <a href="http://envylabs.com/">Envy Labs</a>, the makers of <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>. It was a great conversation and if you're into learning something new everyday, you should <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/24-jason">take a listen</a>.</p>
