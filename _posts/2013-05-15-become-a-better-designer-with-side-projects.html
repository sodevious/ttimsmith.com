<p>This is a talk I gave back in April at <a href="http://minnestar.org/minnebar">Minnebar</a>. As many of you know, I have a couple of side projects, and I wanted to help other people see the benefit of these. You can see the slides <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ttimsmith/become-a-better-designer-with-side-projects\">here</a>.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
