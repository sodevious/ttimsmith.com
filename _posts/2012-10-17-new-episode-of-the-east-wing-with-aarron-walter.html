<p>I had the huge privilege of recording an episode with <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/">Aarron Walter</a>. In case you don't know, he's a great designer, speaker and author. I had such a great time talking to him about how he got started, design problems he encountered at MailChimp and a lot of the work and research that went into writing his book <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion">Designing for Emotion</a>.</p>
