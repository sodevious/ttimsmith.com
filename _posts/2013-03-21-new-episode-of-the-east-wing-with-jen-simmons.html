<p>This week on The East Wing, I had the chance to talk with Jen Simmons. I'm a huge fan of Jen's podcast, The Web Ahead. I didn't tell her this, but she was one of the inspirations behind me starting The East Wing in the first place. We talked about how she got started, the work that goes into her podcast, and a lot more.</p>

<p>You should <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/48-jen">take a listen</a>.</p>
