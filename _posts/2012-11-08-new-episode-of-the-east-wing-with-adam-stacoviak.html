<p>I recorded a new episode of The East Wing this week with <a href="http://adamstacoviak.com/">Adam Stacoviak</a>. For those of you who don't know him, he's a really nice guy. He host three podcasts himself and on the show we talk about podcasting and his role as Product Lead at <a href="https://www.purecharity.com/?aff=36437">Pure Charity</a>.</p>
