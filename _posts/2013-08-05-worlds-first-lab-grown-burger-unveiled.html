<blockquote>
  <p>The 5-ounce “cultured beef” burger was constructed from 20,000 protein strands grown from cow stem cells. The strands were compiled over the weekend and removed from a deep freezer on Monday. It cost $325,000 to produce, and was financed entirely by Google co-founder Sergey Brin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s one expensive burger.</p>
