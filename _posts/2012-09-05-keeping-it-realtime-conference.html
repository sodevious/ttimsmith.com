<p>As you may already know, I recently changed jobs and am now working with the wonderful people at <a href="http://andyet.net/">&amp;yet</a>. Well, they throw this totally awesome conference called <a href="http://2012.krtconf.com/">The Keeping It Realtime Conference</a> which is place to learn all about realtime technologies. I'm so excited to be going out to Portland. You should come! Tickets are selling fast so, get one while you can!</p>
