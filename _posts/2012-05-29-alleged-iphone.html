<p>Two separate iPhone part suppliers have leaked nearly identical-looking versions of what appears to be a backplate for Apple’s next iPhone, both of which support rumors of the device’s lengthened body and redesigned dock connector.</p>

<p>This is so exciting! I’m really looking forward to the release of the iPhone 5. I’m really happy about the larger screen size. However, I do have to say I’m a bit disappointed that the dock connector has been redesigned. If that turns out to be true, I think it’ll be a headache. A lot of us have multiple Apple products and up until now, they awesomely share the same charger. What do you think? Are you excited about the new iPhone?</p>
