Two separate iPhone part suppliers have leaked nearly identical-looking versions of what appears to be a backplate for Apple's next iPhone, both of which support rumors of the device's lengthened body and redesigned dock connector.

This is so exciting! I'm really looking forward to the release of the iPhone 5. I'm really happy about the larger screen size. However, I do have to say I'm a bit disappointed that the dock connector has been redesigned. If that turns out to be true, I think it'll be a headache. A lot of us have multiple Apple products and up until now, they awesomely share the same charger. What do you think? Are you excited about the new iPhone?
