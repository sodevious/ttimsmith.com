<p>This week on The East Wing, I had the pleasure of recording with Chris Wallace. He's a real down-to-earth guy that has gone through a lot in life and never gives up. I admire him a bunch and it was fun hearing more about his story and the exciting things he's working on. You should <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/34-chris">take a listen</a>.</p>
