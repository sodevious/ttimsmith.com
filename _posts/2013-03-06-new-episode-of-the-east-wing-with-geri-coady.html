<p>This week on The East Wing, I had the honor of talking with Geri Coady. Geri is a talend Designer, Illustrator, and Photographer. I'm <em>so</em> jealous of her awesome illustration skills. We talk about how she got started, her venture into freelancing, and her process into choosing colors.</p>
