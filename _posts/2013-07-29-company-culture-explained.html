  _yoast_wpseo_metadesc: This article, beautifully points out the underlying problems
    of “company culture” these days, which although this piece examines startup culture,
    really applies to a much larger amount of companies. At least personally, the
    post describes a lot of the reason I’ve stayed far away from the startup scene.

<blockquote>
  <p>Culture is not about the furniture in your office. It is not about how much time you have to spend on feel-good projects. It is not about catered food, expensive social outings, internal chat tools, your ability to travel all over the world, or your never-ending self-congratulation.</p>

At least personally, the post describes a lot of the reasons why I’ve stayed far away from the startup scene.</p>

<p>Take a look. I’m interested in hearing what you think.</p>
