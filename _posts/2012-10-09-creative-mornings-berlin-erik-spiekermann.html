<p><a href="http://daneden.me/">Dan Eden</a>, recommended this video to me and I loved it. Erik is hilariously condescending but, you can tell the man knows what he's talking about. He gives some interesting insight into type for screens that I found very useful. Pardon for some of the foul language. Pretend you didnâ€™t hear it.</p>
