<p>You might\'ve noticed that I published an <a href=\"http://timothybsmith.com/links/my-article-on-the-treehouse-blog\">article on the Treehouse Blog</a> about business. My friends over at Pagebreak invited me to be on their show and talk about it.

<p>You should <a href=\"http://www.pagebreakpodcast.com/snippets/better-freelance-business-practices/\">take a listen</a>.</p>
