<p>This week on The East Wing, I had a chance to talk with Trent Walton. Trent is the guy behind the awesome art directed articles on his <a href="http://trentwalton.com">personal site</a> and is one-third of <a href="http://paravelinc.com/">Paravel</a>. He's a really great guy and it was nice chatting about how he got into design and the early troubles of Paravel.</p>

<p>You should <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/39-trent">take a listen</a></p>
