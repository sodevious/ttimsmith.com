<p>This week, I had the chance to talk with Jory Raphael. This is a guy that I just loved talking to. He's so talented and successful, but also a down-to-earth guy. We talk about his inspiration behind the 5by5 artwork, how he got his start, and a brilliant app that he's a co-founder of. I think you'll love this episode.</p>
