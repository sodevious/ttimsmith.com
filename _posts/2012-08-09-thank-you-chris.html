<p>I was watching <a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/103-integrating-fitvids-js-into-wordpress/">this tutorial</a> on how to integrate FitVids.js onto my site and this is the video he used as a test. It’s absolutely hilarious. You’ve got to watch it. As a side note, notice that the video above is responsive. Oh yeah...</p>
