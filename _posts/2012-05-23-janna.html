<p>This particular episode of The East Wing is a special one. Not only was the conversation with Janna great, it was the first episode with Galen as my co-host. I really think y'all will love this new arrangement. He brings something special to the show with his opinions, great questions and "Galen's Topic of the Week". If you haven't already, I invite you to subscribe to the show. It's a great one.</p>
