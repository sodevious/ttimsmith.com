<p>This seems like a pretty awesome app. I had to find out if it integrated with Tweetbot because that's where I usually save links from. It definitely shows promise. Now a days, I feel like I do most of my reeding from recommendations on Twitter instead of RSS feeds anyway. What do you think? Will you be giving it a shot?</p>
