<p>This is so exciting. I think Tim Cook made it clear that Apple was interested in this space. However, after iOS 7, I’m skeptical on how well this thing will look and work. I really hope Apple proves me wrong.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/a-new-rss-setup">A New RSS Setup</a></h2>
          <p>July is upon us, and if you forgot to export your feeds out of Google Reader, you have about 6 hours to do it. Come tomorrow, Google Reader will shut down, and an a new era of RSS will begin.</p>

<p>Chris and I talked about alternatives on <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/tltb/do-we-really-want-to-go-back-to-aol/">this week’s Too Lazy to Blog</a>, but at the time, I hadn’t chosen where I’d go. However, I spent yesterday doing some research and I’d love to share my new setup with you.</p>

<h3>Powering the Backend</h3>

<p>There are quite a few choices out there at this point. The problem is that the integrations aren’t great. <a href="http://cloud.feedly.com/">Feedly</a> for example, seems to have a lot of support, but it’s free and I decided early on that I wanted to pay for the service. This way, the likeliness of the service disappearing is smaller.</p>

<p>I decided on <a href="http://feedwrangler.net/welcome.html">Feed Wrangler</a>. I’ve heard some very good things about the service, as well as the developer behind it. Also, it has a pretty cool bookmarklet for you to instantly subscribe to a feed. The UI isn&#8217;t great, but I just need it to power the syncing. I almost never visit the actual site.</p>

<h3>Apps</h3>

<p>I’d previously been using <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. However, only their iPhone app integrates with any of these new services, and there’s no word on when exactly the iPad and Mac apps will follow. Personally, I don’t really enjoy reading on my phone or on my Mac, so it was important to find a service that integrated with a great iPad app.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/">Mr. Reader</a>. Creepy icon aside, the app is really nice. You can customize the reading experience a lot more than Reeder, and the sharing actually works. It has Readability, Twitter, App.net, and Kippt integration which is perfect for me. If you need more than that, have no fear, the app has many different choices.</p>

<p>If you also need a Mac app, I’m most likely going to go with <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a>. Again, integrations look great, and the customization of the reading experience is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that helps. Let me know if you’ve found alternate solutions. I’d love to hear about them. Happy reading!</p>

  <p>But when we only promote our shiniest pieces, we don’t really build confidence. We build shallowness. We start measuring our work in terms of the fame we get out of it, rather than the heart we put into it. We start mistaking praise for progress, and we take projects or jobs that look good on paper (or balance sheets), but do little to help us learn and grow.</p>

<p>I’ve told Sara she’s one of my favorite writers, and a piece likes this just makes me like her more. I admire writing that is able to expose the true self, and I hope that one day, I can be this vulnerable with my writing.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/tim-likes-to-teach-gets-a-redesign-2">Tim Likes to Teach Get’s a Redesign</a></h2>
          <p>Today, I launched the new <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com">Tim Likes to Teach</a>. This redesign has been in the works for about three months. Not a huge amount of time, but considering that when I started, it was only supposed to be a minor update, it ended up taking quite a while.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very proud of this new design, and if you&#8217;re an existing customer, I think you’re going to love it. The old site had quite a bit of pain points, and I think this new design addresses them very well.</p>

<p>The beauty of this redesign is, I’ve improved the back-end to make it easy to add new courses and videos. I&#8217;m new using a custom post type for courses and course videos, then connecting them with a plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/">Posts to Posts</a>. </p>

<p>The experience has greatly improved on the front-end too. In the past, videos were on a page and some couldn’t even find them. <strong>It was totally my fault</strong>. When I first designed the site, the plan was to have you download all the video files, so the design didn&#8217;t work when that plan didn&#8217;t work. </p>

<p>Now, I feel the site has a good flow to it. Breadcrumbs do a good job of helping you remember where you are, and give quick access to the course homepage. </p>

<h3>A New Course</h3>

<p>As promised, I’ve started to post videos for the new course “Redesign a Podcast Website”. Lots of people have showed interest in this project since there are some interesting design and development problems to solve.</p>

<p>This course is currently in progress, and I&#8217;m recording and adding new videos everyday.</p>

<h3>A New Business Model</h3>

<p>As most of you know, I&#8217;m now <a href="http://ttimsmith.com/articles/the-future-of-tim-smith">full-time on my own projects</a>, so I&#8217;m looking for ways to generate enough income to sustain myself. With that in mind, Tim Likes to Teach has moved to a subscription model. </p>

<p>For only $8.99/month, you get access to all courses and respective downloads. There is a formal plan for future courses, and I&#8217;m already doing pre-production on these.</p>

<p>Again, I hope you love this new design. As always, my goal remains the same: to help people learn the web with their friendly internet pal, me. </p>
