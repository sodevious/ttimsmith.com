          <img src="/uploads/2012/10/ma1-hero.png" alt="Layout Preview" />

<p>So this a quick update on Make Awesome. I've started to set deadlines for myself so that I actually start getting things done. My Kickstarter video will be up this week come hell or high water. I'd love to see how much interest there is around the idea. For me, it'd be a dream come true to get this published and in the hands of people.</p>

<p>I've chosen the typefaces for the project, which will be <a href="http://www.bariol.com/">Bariol</a>, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/skolar/">Skolar</a> and <a href="http://pictos.cc/font/">Pictos</a> for the icons. I've worked with Skolar before on the web and it's a beautiful typeface that works very well with extended copy. Bariol is also a beautiful typeface and gives the publication and formal yet casual feel at the same time. Pictos is also a great icon font designed by <a href="http://drewwilson.com/">Drew Wilson</a> that has the style I was going for.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see a layout I had worked on, you should <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/750642-Progress">look at this</a>. I've changed the layout of it already but, the color and style is pretty defined. It's interesting how I've been creating online editorial environments for most of my career yet I've had to learn how to create one for print. The whole mentality is different. Leave a comment with your thoughts on the layout!</p>

          <p>So as I said earlier today, my time at <a href="http://andyet.net">&amp;yet</a> has ended. I really liked the team and enjoyed my time there but they're looking for someone that is more developer oriented. In fact, if you're looking for a front-end position, you should check them out. They're a great team and I appreciate everything they've done for me.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I'll be looking for freelance work or a full-time position. If you know of anything or you have a web project you'd like me to work on, <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>! I'd love to talk.</p>

          <p>I had been talking with <a href="http://www.jannahagan.com/">Janna</a> about writing for her blog since June. I had been so busy that I just didn't have the time to sit down and write something (or maybe it was lack of inspiration? I don't know). Finally, last week I sat down and was able to write close to 800 words on <em>setting yourself up right</em>. I'm really happy and excited about this article.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/always-changing-things-up">Always Changing Things Up</a></h2>
          <p>What a shock that this site got another refresh right? Well, I'm happy to push this new design out. I've been learning a lot in the past couple of weeks and one of those things is SCSS. I can't believe I hadn't used this in my daily workflow before. I was introduced to it at the beginning of this year by my pal <a href="https://twitter.com/kenearley">Ken Earley</a>. It wasn't until recently that I've been working with it more closely and I'm amazed at how much time you can save by using it. I'll be creating a screencast later this week to show you some of the power of SCSS.</p>

<p>Anyway, this new site is built with more semantic code (I'm trying to use elements like <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code> and <code>article</code>) and SCSS. I also think the new design is a lot cleaner and easy to read.</p>

<p>Honestly though, there have been a lot of changes recently, both personally and professionally. Some have been good and others have been bad. It's been tough to deal with some of the mistakes I've made recently but, I chose not to focus on the negative. I want to focus on the positive; how I can make better decisions moving forward and see the benefits of these soon. This is a lot more mushy than I normally am on here but, to sum up, I'm confident that I'm now headed in the right direction and things are looking very bright.</p>

  <p>Hey Tim,</p>
  <p>Just wanted to say I love your show. I'm a newer web designer (1.5 years) and former tv news videojournalist so I got to work with a lot of reporters and conduct a lot of interviews as well. From both angles you do a great job of getting guests to open up and share their knowledge and experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This morning, I woke up to that email. It made my day. This is not an effort to inflate my ego. What made my day was that he is finding my rinky-dink show useful. He's enjoying the guests and it's my hope that the show is helping him learn a thing or two in his new industry.</p>

<p>For me, it just drills home that if you're nice and you work hard, great things happen. The show has helped me personally in so many ways and I'm so glad it helps others too.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/on-app-net">Thoughts on App.net</a></h2>
          <p>So there's been a lot of talk around this idea of <a href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a>. Now I'll be honest and admit that I wasn't too sold on the idea when I first heard of it. It's a paid social network after all. However, as I thought more about it, the idea became more convincing to me.</p>

<p>I've been involved in a couple of businesses that failed and a prevalent pattern seems to be that lack of confidence to charge for the product you're selling. When you don't charge for your product, you need someone to fund it. Who? VC's. Angel investors. These people become your customers, the one's you cater to and the products become crap for the actual people who need to use it. That's what's happening with Twitter and will become more and more apparent as time goes by.</p>

<p><a href="https://join.app.net">App.net</a> promises to not go down this route because it's a paid service. Who'd use a paid social network? Honestly, I don't know. I think there are parts of this business model which aren't being thought about. I mostly agree with <a href="http://samsoff.es/posts/app-net-is-dreaming-small">Sam's thoughts</a>, they're not dreaming big enough&hellip; yet. But, I do feel that they have a good idea and are headed in the right direction. They're being upfront and gutsy and as a paying customer, I'll be cared for and won't have ads shoved in my face.</p>

<p>I hope more people jump on this bandwagon and it's also my hope that third-party developers that have been treated badly by Twitter can begin to develop on the App.net platform (I'm looking at you Tweetbot!). If you decide to join, I'm <a href="https://alpha.app.net/ttimsmith">@ttimsmith</a> as always.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out. I don't know if it'll be successful. I don't know if I'll later regret writing this. But, I respect a business that's willing to charge for a product that our society seems to value at nothing. Quality has a price and unfortunately it's undervalued. You always get what you pay for.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> App.net has been funded!</p>

          <p>I'm going thru this list of articles that I once published on this very site and now republishing them on <a href="http://timlikestowrite.com">timlikestowrite.com</a>. This particular one, I wrote back in March of 2011. I'm trying not to edit them because I 2011 Tim to shine through and let me tell you, he sounds horrible. Either way, it's fun to read over things I wrote a long time ago. It's a great to see how much has changed in the way I think and lessons I've learned. Anyway, go check it out!</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/update-to-the-feed">Update to the Feed</a></h2>
          <p>Hi Everyone! So I deleted the old feed and created a new one. Why? The old one had ads on it back when I believed in “monetizing” everything (I was so stupid). The problem was, I couldn’t delete the ads anymore. I had done some type of intricate who-knows-what and was now stuck. The only way out was to delete the feed and start fresh so that’s what I did. You can now subscribe to the new feed <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/timothybsmith">here</a> or with the RSS link above. As always, thanks for reading!</p>
