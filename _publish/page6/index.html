          <h2><a href="/articles/silicon-valley-can-suck-it">Silicon Valley Can Suck It</a></h2>
          <p>You might hear me complain about how much I dislike start ups and the Silicon Valley culture. I seem to tweet about it a lot and I have private conversations with friends about it. I thought I'd write to try and organize my thoughts.</p>

<p>I think the reasons I dislike start up culture come down to two things. It's detached and not personal, and I feel it's downright douchey most of the time.</p>

<h3>Detached and Not Personal</h3>

<p>This is my biggest gripe against startups and venture capitalists. It's very detached. There is a common saying that goes, "It's not personal, it's business". Although I mostly agree with these words, I feel like there needs to be a little bit of a personal element.</p>

<p>Too many companies throw the needs of their users away for the money that the guys with big pockets can throw at them. These companies aren't solving people problems, they're coming up with ideas that get them funded. It might seem like the same thing, but it's not. I know that money pays the bills as much as the next guy but the start up culture promotes making billions, not doing what you love and living with what's necessary.</p>

<p>It's amazing to me that people covet having millions of dollars, a downtown loft and private jets. Everything comes at a price and those who live that life are empty, work most of the time, and don't have meaningful human relationships.</p>

<h3>It's Downright Douchey</h3>

<p>I don't care if your buddy is the ex-co-founder of Twitter. Don't talk to me about pivoting and please don't tell me your idea is the Facebook &amp; Netflix of mommy blogging.</p>

<p>Being an entrepreneur used to mean something. Entrepreneurs were innovators. They weren't content with the way things were and dreamt of new and better ways to do them; it wasn't something you could just put in your Twitter bio and it certainly didn't give you license to be a douche.</p>

<p>Sure, I like to make things. Yes, I might not always think about my products all the way through. I may never be rich. But, damn it, I will have had fun. I will have had passion for the things I get involved in and I will love my family and my friends to the death.</p>

<p>So, I invite you to make business personal again. Have fun. Be nice. Do what you love and make sure you have time for the important people in your life. Money makes no one happy and I'm pretty damn sure "pivoting" doesn't either.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That's a sentence I wholeheartedly agree with. In his article, Joshua goes on to explain information that can be gathered about your product before it launches and I agree with that as well. However, it's been my experience that people tend to over analyze things. I've been on both sides of the spectrum where in one case, too much pre-launch work was being done where we should've had a priority to ship, and another where we should've waited to launch.</p>

<p>It's difficult to find the balance but, I know there is one. My pal Jared Erondu <a href="http://twitter.com/erondu/status/262010897319481345">tweeted</a> the other day that it's vital to believe in the product your building. There comes a point where I feel a team thinking and re-thinking the different aspects of a product starts to feel like a lack of faith. That's the moment where you either fire them or, you get out. At least personally, I'd rather start generating income and being paid to improve an already launched product than sit on it for months and realize it's been headed in the wrong direction.</p>

          <img src="/uploads/2012/10/insites-cover.png" alt="The Cover of Insites: The Book" />

<p>I had the absolute pleasure of receiving my copy of <em>Insites: The Book</em> in the mail yesterday. I was excited to take it out of its packaging and delve into what turned out to be some fantastic reading (but, I'll get to that in a moment).</p>

<p>The care, love and absolute craftsmanship that has gone into creating this beautiful book is outstanding and deserves praise. Not only does the book smell fresh off the press, the stock, and type and imagery within are beautiful. I admire the work that Elliot and Keir have done. It's a showcase of attention to detail. As someone very interested in the work that goes into creating a print publication, I can't begin to imagine all the difficult design decisions that were made for this book.</p>

<h3>On The Inside</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though their backgrounds are diverse, there's one trait our contributors all share: the love what they do. From that love springs their trademark craftsmanship and relentless curiosity. Their passion is what we appreciate about their work, and in turn, it's what we appreciate about them.
  <small>Aarron Walter</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let's talk about the content. The interviews and spectacular pieces by <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/">Aaron Walter</a> and <a href="http://blog.fictivecameron.com/">Cameron Koczon</a> truly resonate with me. The people interviewed are of amazing success and it's great to read something with such an inspiring and coherent theme. Every single one of these people have chosen to do what they love and to create new things with love. It's this motivation which has created Brooklyn Beta, A Book Apart, Creative Mornings and more.</p>

<p>Personally, it engraved in my mind that I should be creating things with this same incentive. As Cameron states in his foreword, it's the way we add depth to our online community; the way we extend beyond our small avatars and 160-character bios. I for one, am very happy to be part of this group of caring and smart people.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, you should <a href="http://shop.viewportindustries.com/products/insites-the-book">order your copy</a>.</p>

  <p>Visual design is more than an outlet for the aesthetic you're into right now.

<p>This small tweet by Allison really got me thinking about my own work. It merits thinking about because what this quote really asks is if you're designing according to the goals of the website and the needs of its users or only according to the trend you're into at the moment.</p>

<p>There is a lot to be said for the difference between planning for six months, developing for a year, learning that your users don’t want to pay for something, pivoting, starting over on development, and having your investors clean you out, as opposed to launching an open-ended, simple, and small version of a great product in which users tell you exactly what they’re willing to pay for while they’re already paying you.

<p>I came across this excerpt from Execute, a book by <a href="http://drewwilson.com/">Drew Wilson</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/joshlong">Josh Long</a>. I pre-ordered a while back and I highly recommend you do to. I've had the chance to talk with Drew and I really admire the guy. He get's things done without even breaking a sweat; at least that's how it looks from the outside.</p>

<p>Drew has created several income generating products and make a living from them. I think we'd all love to do the same. <a href="http://executebook.com/">Pre-order the book</a> and maybe some of Drew's genius will rub off.</p>

<p>What an amazing article by <a href="http://brianhoff.net/">Brian Hoff</a> telling businesses to value the work done by a website. In it, he talks about paying up to $100k for his own site.

          <h2><a href="/articles/i-cant-write">I Can’t Write</a></h2>
          <p>I wish I could. I really do. I wish I could be one of those prolific writers that sit down and pump out a thousand words easily. I can count one piece that I've written which has exceeded a thousand words and that might even include homework assignments from high school (did I mention I wasn't a good student?)</p>

<p>So how do they do it? I've heard that some dedicate a time in the day to write. An hour, maybe two where they sit down and write something. My pal <a href="http://blog.jarederondu.com/">Jared Erondu</a> used to write 10-20 pieces a day for a blog he founded and is now the Editor of The Industry at the age of 18. He's half man, half amazing.</p>

<p>Is it a gene? A natural talent? Can you develop this talent? At least in our industry, I'm always talking to designers and developers who say its essential to write. Not only to develop your thoughts and truly know what you're feeling, but to also share the work you're doing. I've tried to do some of that myself and I've found it very therapeutic.</p>

<p>However, I'm coming to realize that the problem I have with my writing is that I feel no one reads it. Maybe that's the adjustment I need to make. Why do I care if people read my horrendously written thoughts? That's something I learned from <a href="http://daneden.me/">Dan Eden</a>. He told me in a <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/29-dan">recent interview</a> that he started blogging because of course he wanted to be like Chris Coyier some day, I mean, who doesn't? But also because it was his playground. Somewhere he could express his thoughts and the latest techniques he was learning.</p>

<p>To me, it really nailed home the idea that I should be writing because I want to do it and that's it. If no one reads, that's quite alright. It helps me organize my thoughts and ultimately makes me a better designer.</p>

<p>So if you're thinking of starting a blog or you've already started one but you've abandoned it, I encourage you to keep it up. Share the link in the comments and I'll be sure to visit.</p>

<p>From this day forward, I'm going to write for one hour each day. Some of these are going to really suck but, I hope you'll join me.</p>

          <p>I've been thinking a lot about this recently and I'm writing this in an effort to better explain the project and hopefully convince you more effectively than the video on Kickstarter. The truth is, the video doesn't do this project justice, but that's a completely different topic.</p>

<p>When I launched Make Awesome, I had a general and, honestly, vague idea. It was a dream that hadn't been completely fleshed out yet and three weeks later, I now understand what I want this project to accomplish a lot more than I did when I initially launched it.</p>

<p>Since the project's inception, I've had the privilege of doing some interviews that have helped me create a better vision and I'd like to transmit this idea to you.</p>

<p>The point of this magazine is celebrate young and relatively unknown people in our web industry. It aims to not only get you thinking about where our industry is heading and new, creative ways to solve new problems; it invites you to enjoy life and to remember that work is only the tool that allows us to enjoy it.</p>

<p>I'd say that the magazine will not only be a design magazine but a lifestyle magazine. One that examines what creatives do outside of work and gives suggestions about getting away from the noise. That's also the reason why I want the magazine to only be print. I completely agree with <a href="http://www.offscreenmag.com/">Kai Brach</a>. We are so attached to our devices and I hope that this magazine serves as a much needed break to relax on the couch, have a freshly brewed cup of coffee and read the inspiring stories of others that, hopefully inspire you to continue working on your own.</p>

<p>If you are a person that loves what you do and has a passion for doing great work, this is the magazine about you. Our industry needs a publication about and for the regular people: those of us who don't write books, speak at conferences or interview for big publications. Make Awesome is that publication and the magazine is only the beginning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothybsmith/make-awesome-magazine">Back this project</a>, share the magazine and share the vision.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/keeping-your-cool">Keeping Your Cool</a></h2>
          <p>If you're reading this, you probably know me. If you don't, read other articles on this site or listen to my <a href="http://theeastwing.net">podcast</a>. Don't worry, I'll wait.</p>

<p>Ok, now that you know who I am and a bit of my personality, you'll agree when I say that I'm a nice guy. I'm the type of person that opens the door for women, keep my elbows off the table and always put my napkin on my lap. I'm nice, well-mannered and respectful.</p>

<p>Yet, like everyone else, I get upset. People at times say hurtful things because, hell, they're on the internet and there is nothing you can do. My pal <a href="http://twitter.com/mattepp">Matt</a> told me yesterday that basically “trolls gonna troll” and it's very true. Some people find satisfaction in bringing other people down and that's just something you have to deal with in your life.</p>

<h3>Anyway</h3>

<p>The point of this post is to talk about keeping your cool. There have been times recently where nothing would have made me happier then to go all Mike Tyson up on some people but, it's not worth it. That's something I'm very proud to say that my mother taught me. It's never worth reducing to someone's level.</p>

<p>What has worked for me, is that I always remember that there is a real person on the other side of the screen. Always. I don't want to be the cause of anyone's feelings being hurt. This isn't common but, I've chosen not to care about what other people do.</p>

<p>I will always be nice. When I offer criticism, it will be constructive and with tact. When someone decides to troll, my response will be one filled with respect. This is how we make the web a better place: when we decide to not say anything that we wouldn't say to someone in person and as I'm sure everyone's mother said at one point, “If you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all”. Because, honestly, the time spent hurting people could be better spent doing something great yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Be nice.</strong></p>

          <p>I’ve been running my own business for about a month now and, wow, have a learned a ton. However, the invaluable things I've learned will come in a later post. I'm here to talk about clients.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it seems that everyone wants the high profile clients. People with big ideas, the next great product. I admit that I'm included in that group. I would love to design for <a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a> or a product similar to that. However, I made realization today that great clients and exciting work can come from anywhere.</p>

<p>I'm currently working with a client whose business is to sell truck bodies. To the typical person, this would seem like a regular client; maybe not something to get excited about. Yet, I am excited about this project.</p>

<p>The owner of the business is a blue collar worker who genuinely cares about his business and the quality they can provide for their customers. He understands his business, the needs of the customers and how important it is to have a web presence. He's open to new ideas and accepts the opinions of the professionals, which in this case, is me.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't really know what I want to accomplish with this post; I think it's to persuade people to give clients the benefit of the doubt and not consider any project to small. For me, this experience was unexpected and I'm so glad I've had the chance to work with these people. What about you? Have you ever felt that you had a great unexpected experience with a client?</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/dont-be-a-douche-pay-for-quality-stuff">Don’t Be a Douche. Pay for Quality Stuff</a></h2>
          <p>I know that the title is sensational. I'm hoping that people read this just because they're offended at it. Still, the point I'd like to make is important. A very <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/">quality piece of software</a> came out today and almost immediately, people began to complain about how they weren't happy with the price.</p>

<p>This is a discussion that happens often. The value of apps are always being measured and I think, unfortunately, the trend is to sway on the low side. I feel like people don't realize how much work goes into creating a quality application. Countless hours of work; thinking, discussing UX, refining the design, thinking through interactions and development. We're not talking a couple of days here; we're talking months of full-time work. In this case, Tapbots has created Tweetbot for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. Quality products deserve to be paid for and the guys at Tapbots have done an amazing job with this suite of applications. Don't be a douche. Pay for their stuff.</p>

          <p>I had the huge privilege of recording an episode with <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/">Aarron Walter</a>. In case you don't know, he's a great designer, speaker and author. I had such a great time talking to him about how he got started, design problems he encountered at MailChimp and a lot of the work and research that went into writing his book <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion">Designing for Emotion</a>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/look-ma-i-own-a-company">Look Ma! I Own a Company!</a></h2>
          <p>Today was the quite the interesting day. I'm officially the owner of Anythin' Goes LLC. I'm a business owner and that freaks me out.</p>

<h3>The Reason Behind the Name</h3>

<p>I chose Anythin’ Goes because I want it to be the parent company over my different projects. I'm not only doing design work, I host a <a href="http://theeastwing.net">podcast</a> and soon (hopefully) I'll be publishing a <a href="http://makeaweso.me">magazine</a>. </p>

<p>I don't know exactly what lies in the future for me or the company but I'm excited to find out and I hope you'll come along for the ride. I think this is all for the best. I feel like finally things are turning around and I'm headed in a good direction, both in my life and career.</p>

          <p>I had the privilege of talking with <a href="http://daneden.me/">Dan Eden</a> on The East Wing. He's a really nice guy. The man has tons of self-started side projects and we go through them one by one. He's got some very interesting things to say so you should <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/29-dan">take a listen</a>.</p>
