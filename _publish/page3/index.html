          <h2><a href="/articles/its-not-that-complicated">It’s Not That Complicated</a></h2>
          <p>When I first got into this industry, things were a lot simpler. We didn’t worry about designing responsively, and there were no “mobile strategies”.</p>

<p>The iPhone hadn’t even come out yet. My workflow consisted of designing in Photoshop, slicing the design into tons of PNG’s, and coding all of this up in Dreamweaver.<sup id="fnref-1511:1"><a href="#fn-1511:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I’m glad we’ve come so far in the past years. I feel like we’ve collectively improved the web a lot. People involved in web projects are thinking about process, strategy, user experience, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Yet, for graduating students, or anyone else barely entering our industry, I can see how it could seem overwhelming. Every day, there seems to be a new technology we should be learning, or articles explaining something we’re not paying attention to. Job postings don’t really help. A lot of these postings use big words, and the whole hiring process can be very intimidating.</p>

<p>As someone who’s been in his fair share of interviews, don’t let these intimidate you. Every time I started a new job, I’d get nervous that I wouldn’t be able to do it. Yet, I’ve learned that the web can be complicated, but if you’re hard working and eager to learn, everything else can be taught.</p>

<p>So if you’re feeling stressed, take a break. Think about something else. When you get back, try your best. That’s really the only thing you can be asked for.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/overcoming-yourself">Overcoming Yourself</a></h2>
          <p>Writing for me, is one of those things I wish I could be great at. I can read pieces by other people, and be moved, inspired, motivated, and more with a single paragraph. Great writers are able to convey emotion and tell a story while keeping you interested with every word.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I've told myself that I can't write. I've noticed that I have the power to hold myself back, if I don't fight against the urge to talk myself out of things. If I want to be a great writer, what better way than to practice a little everyday?</p>

<p><strong>That’s exactly what I’m doing.</strong></p>

<p>I'm tired of telling myself I can't do something; that's the world's job. I can't draw, I can't play piano, I can't be fit, etc; it's rubbish. I can do all those things. The only thing in the way is <strong>me</strong>.</p>

<p>It's quite an interesting moment when you realize the biggest hurdle to overcome is your own cynicism; that's ridiculous. If anything, you should be rooting for your own self.</p>

<p>I give up on trying to stop myself from doing something I really want; you could be on the edge of greatness and not realize it.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/on-redesigns">On Redesigns</a></h2>
          <p>What is the point of redesigning something? What's trying to be accomplished? Whether it be an app, website, or any type of product, clear goals are behind necessary redesigns.</p>

<p>When clients have come to me in the past to redesign their website or brand, the first question out of my mouth, is why. Often, people have an idea of what they're trying to accomplish:  they want more customers, they'd like to provide current users with a better experience, they'd like to create a future-friendly website, etc.</p>

<p>Redesigning for the sake of change is limited to personal sites. This should never be a strategy where the user experience is actually important.</p>

<p>As designers, it's necessary we think these things through. Too many people believe that design is purely visual, and sometimes, we contribute to that incorrect assumption. The reality is, design is heavily reliant on asking the right questions, and properly analyzing the answers.</p>

<p>When we do this, we can create designs that improve an experience, and possibly improve the lives of our users.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/make-your-own-club">Make Your Own Club</a></h2>
          <p>I've never felt like I belong to a club. In school, I wasn't popular, I didn't play sports, nor was I a good student. I didn't really fit in.</p>

<p>For most of my school years, it bothered me. I became a person I wasn't, just to be accepted. It wasn't until the final years of high school that I realized I could just be myself, and not care. I could find friends who liked me for me.</p>

<p>In a certain way, this type of thing continues in work and on the web. The popular people and the ones who aren't. Unlike high school, the popular kids are mostly really nice. However, I've noticed that I —and many others— continue wanting to be part of the club.</p>

<p><strong>What is “the club” anyways?</strong></p>

<p>What we sometimes forget is that there are lots of clubs, and being active on the web is as easy as reaching out. If you don't seem to find one that suits you, make one. Create a place where you feel comfortable and can be edifying to others.</p>

<p>Being friends with big names isn't what makes you awesome, being kind and respectful does. You can't give people too much importance; sometimes, even your heroes will let you down. Time spent resenting is time not spent on doing great work.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>This interview in a lot of ways is ridiculous. Walt and Kara went a bit to the extreme in trying not to show any bias towards Apple, and instead were a bit harsh. Although, I can understand how difficult it must be to conduct an objective and unbiased interview with the CEO of arguably the best technology company at the moment.</p>

<p>Tim seems very confident in Apple and it's future, and why wouldn't he? Their stock price has nothing to do with the success Apple has reached, nor does it say anything about the legacy they've already created for themselves. Anyone who follows Apple knows that they're working on something big, and their silence only guarantees that.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/i-dont-know-what-im-doing">I Don’t Know What I’m Doing</a></h2>
          <p>This is a phrase I’m getting into the habit of saying more. It's completely true, and the more I say it, the more benefit I seem to get out of it.</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but as humans, we like to give the illusion of having knowledge; whether it be true or not. I know I do. I love making people feel like I know what's going on and how to handle a situation.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t.</strong></p>

<p>Instead, I’ve tried to be more open about the things I don't know and I've been very happy with the results. The great part of admitting ones shortcomings, is the opportunity it creates for learning. You’d be amazed how willing people are to give help and advice. It's my belief that with a little humility, and a willingness to learn, there is nothing you can't accomplish.</p>

<p>What are you admitting to not knowing today?</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/the-future-of-tim-smith">The Future of Tim Smith</a></h2>
          <p>I've quit my job and stopped looking for full-time work. What's next for me then?</p>

<p>As I've explained in a <a href="/articles/dealing-with-insecurities">previous post</a>, the past year has been quite the journey. I moved across the country, worked with some great people, and made some bad choices. However, this post isn't about reflecting on the past; I've done enough of that. I'm done.</p>

<p>Some of you may know that I recently quit my job at <a href="http://rocketlift.com">Rocket Lift</a>. I can't send enough love to those guys. They are hands down the best team I've worked with so far, and there was seldom a day when I wasn't excited to get to work.<sup id="fnref-1447:1"><a href="#fn-1447:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>My first inclination was to find another full-time job. I applied in a couple of different places that I was interested in, some didn't get back to me, and a few interviewed me. After this whole process, I realized that there's really only one company I'd actually like to work for, and that's <a href="http://lift.gs">Lift</a>.</p>

<p>Lift<sup id="fnref-1447:2"><a href="#fn-1447:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> is a great company that’s working on some very exciting things. I feel like I could learn a lot and I know <a href="http://chris-wallace.com">Chris</a> likes that I have all these side-projects. If there was ever a good fit for me, I think it’d be there.</p>

<p>However, since they’re not offering a position at the moment, I stepped back and questioned why I was looking for a full-time job in the first place. I'm single.<sup id="fnref-1447:3"><a href="#fn-1447:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> I have no family to support. Why work full-time, make tons of money, yet not have the ability to freely work on my side-projects, when these are what bring me joy? That's when it hit me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…I’d rather be poor and do something I love than make lots of money doing something I don’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People spend a lifetime stuck in a routine they hate. They wake up at the crack of dawn, sit in traffic, work for 8 or 10 hours, come home, and start all over again. I don't want this for myself. Ever. Life was created to be enjoyed, and that doesn't sound like joy to me.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, if there is a position that I feel will be good for me and these projects, I’ll take it. Till now, most of the companies I’ve interviewed with had no knowlege of my side projects<sup id="fnref-1447:4"><a href="#fn-1447:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, nor did they show any interest in them. For me, this is a huge red flag, and one of the reasons I’ve turned down some offers.</p>

<p>My projects are important to me, and what these employers don’t realize, is that these ventures make me a better employee, and in some cases, bring attention to their companies.</p>

<h3>What I'm Doing Instead</h3>

<p>I know I have the skill and talent to create things people love, and will be willing to pay for. More importantly, I'm fortunate to have people who like what I do, and want to support my endeavors. The plan is to make the things I'm already doing profitable.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Consulting Work</strong><br />
I'm a great Designer and Front-End Developer. At the moment I'm taking clients for the next couple of months. If you, or someone you know, needs a designer, please <a href="/portfolio">take a look at my portfolio</a>. You can also <a href="http://zerply.com/ttimsmith/endorse">read what others have said about me</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The East Wing</strong><br />
This show is special to me. It's definitely my favorite project to work on. However, it needs to become more profitable. Each month, we attract around 20k people. That means we should be able to sell sponsorships at a higher rate. I've also created <a href="http://theeastwing.net/membership">memberships</a> for the show. If you love the show, and you kinda-sorta like me, please consider becoming a member. These memberships help pay me for the time I put into it, and honestly, will help me pay my rent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lustra Magazine</strong><br />
I'll be submitting <a href="http://lustramag.com/">Lustra</a> to the App Store at the beginning of June; that's a hard deadline. I've completely redesigned the magazine for the iPad, and —not to toot my own horn— it's looking beautiful. I think you're really going to like it and if this first issue is a success, I have some exciting plans for the project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tim Likes to Teach</strong><br />
This project in particular has a lot of untapped potential. A considerable amount of people loved <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/">Tim Likes to Teach</a>. I'll be deploying a beautiful new design that improves the experience of the site. It will soon be moving to a subscription where you get access to everything for only $8.99 a month. I have a pretty cool course plan for this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bytesize</strong><br />
This is a new show I plan to do. It's a weekly news update focused on the tech, design, and development industries. You can <a href="http://bytesizenews.co/">sign up for the newsletter</a> to be notified of when the show launches. This show is part of a bigger plan, that I can't wait to show you.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So that's the plan; make a living from the projects I currently have, and more that I won't talk about yet. If you're interested in supporting me, and this plan, consider <a href="http://theeastwing.net/membership">becoming a member</a> on The East Wing. It's inexpensive, and the more support it gets, the less I'll have to worry about sponsorships.</p>

<p>I’d like to reiterate that I have no idea what I’m doing. Who knows? Maybe I’ll have to end up taking a job to make my bills. I really hope not. I think these things have the potential to earn me a living.</p>

<p>Thank you so much, without you, this wouldn’t even be a possibility.</p>

          <p>I'll be honest, only recently was I recommended Instacast by my friend <a href="http://mykehurley.net/">Myke Hurley</a>. This app has changed the way I consume shows. For me, the ability to have show notes, cloud syncing, and a simple and easy to use Mac App, has made the whole Instacast experience one I can recommend whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>If you're like me, I'd gotten so frustrated with the bloat of iTunes and now with Instacast for Mac, I'll never have to open iTunes ever again (hopefully). I've been beta testing the app for a couple of weeks now, and I made sure to purchase a license now that it's out of beta. It's currently on sale for $14.99 until May 31st.</p>

          <p>This week, I had the opportunity to talk with Ashley Baxter. Ashley describes herself as a tinkerer of many things, and I agree. At a young age, she took over the family business and has branched out into other products. We talk about how she got started, her first talk, and more.</p>

          <p><p>This is a talk I gave back in April at <a href="http://minnestar.org/minnebar">Minnebar</a>. As many of you know, I have a couple of side projects, and I wanted to help other people see the benefit of these. You can see the slides <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ttimsmith/become-a-better-designer-with-side-projects\">here</a>.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think!</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/the-future-of-lustra-magazine">The Future of Lustra Magazine</a></h2>
          <p>I regret to inform you that I'm killing it… nah, I'm just kidding. Who writes a post about killing something and calls it <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/fireworks/2013/05/the-future-of-adobe-fireworks.html">The Future of…</a>? Idiots. This post is not about the death of <a href="http://lustramag.com/">Lustra</a>. In fact, it's about its rebirth.</p>

<p>Lustra has been quite the journey. It started off as a horrible <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothybsmith/make-awesome-magazine">Kickstarter campaign</a> that failed, was rebranded as Lustra, and then left alone as I slowly lost passion for it.</p>

<p>The past few months have been tough. We didn't get nearly as much sponsorship support as I'd hoped, and the cost of printing and shipping was a lot larger than what we had in the bank. We were stuck between a rock and hard place. We couldn't print the thing, yet had used some of the sponsorship towards costs relating to the magazine. I was stressed, and the project had become the bain of my existence.<sup id="fnref-1408:1"><a href="#fn-1408:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>All of this was going through my mind, and I couldn't figure out a way to quit. I was torn. I wanted to quit, but I didn't want to, nor could I. Then, yesterday, while sipping on a strawberry lemonade &mdash; I recommend one if you're having brain blockage &mdash; the lightbulb came on. I'd design the magazine as an iPad only magazine.</p>

<img src="/uploads/2013/05/lustra-demo-jason.jpg" alt="Jason's Design for People Article" />

<p>The magazine will come out as a single-issue app in the App Store. I know this will limit the amount of people that can have access, however the pros outweigh the cons at the moment. We'll be able to publish the magazine under budget, I won't have to worry about shipping and fulfillment, and I'll be able to design the reading experience beautifully. Lustra will be one of the few design magazines that looks great on the iPad.<sup id="fnref-1408:2"><a href="#fn-1408:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
