          <h2><a href="/articles/the-future-of-lustra-magazine">The Future of Lustra Magazine</a></h2>
          <p>I regret to inform you that I'm killing it… nah, I'm just kidding. Who writes a post about killing something and calls it <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/fireworks/2013/05/the-future-of-adobe-fireworks.html">The Future of…</a>? Idiots. This post is not about the death of <a href="http://lustramag.com/">Lustra</a>. In fact, it's about its rebirth.</p>

<p>Lustra has been quite the journey. It started off as a horrible <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothybsmith/make-awesome-magazine">Kickstarter campaign</a> that failed, was rebranded as Lustra, and then left alone as I slowly lost passion for it.</p>

<p>The past few months have been tough. We didn't get nearly as much sponsorship support as I'd hoped, and the cost of printing and shipping was a lot larger than what we had in the bank. We were stuck between a rock and hard place. We couldn't print the thing, yet had used some of the sponsorship towards costs relating to the magazine. I was stressed, and the project had become the bain of my existence.<sup id="fnref-1408:1"><a href="#fn-1408:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>All of this was going through my mind, and I couldn't figure out a way to quit. I was torn. I wanted to quit, but I didn't want to, nor could I. Then, yesterday, while sipping on a strawberry lemonade &mdash; I recommend one if you're having brain blockage &mdash; the lightbulb came on. I'd design the magazine as an iPad only magazine.</p>

<img src="/uploads/2013/05/lustra-demo-jason.jpg" alt="Jason's Design for People Article" />

<p>The magazine will come out as a single-issue app in the App Store. I know this will limit the amount of people that can have access, however the pros outweigh the cons at the moment. We'll be able to publish the magazine under budget, I won't have to worry about shipping and fulfillment, and I'll be able to design the reading experience beautifully. Lustra will be one of the few design magazines that looks great on the iPad.<sup id="fnref-1408:2"><a href="#fn-1408:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<img src="/uploads/2013/05/lustra-demo-paddy.jpg" alt="Paddy's Act Article" />

          <h2><a href="/articles/dealing-with-insecurities">Dealing with Insecurities</a></h2>
          <p>I'm not one to suffer of low self-confidence much, but like everyone else, I have my moments. And this is one of them. I'm insecure; I'm scared; I'm worried.</p>

<p>The past eight months have been interesting. I left a great job for more money somewhere else, and was subsequently fired. I made personal decisions that hurt my family, and those who love me. To say the least, when I felt that everything was going well, the rug was pulled from under me.</p>

<p>I've suffered the consequences of these bad decisions, yet grown in ways I couldn't have imagined. I've become confident with the person I am, proud of the person I've become, and am becoming.</p>

<p>I’ve become a person that thinks about saving money. A person that doesn’t take decisions motivated by greed, but instead with humility and a goal to keep things simple. Someone who understands that my decisions affect others, and to think otherwise is selfish. And what real love is, and how what you do says so much more than anything you could possibly say.</p>

<p>That said, I deal with the feelings of regret everyday. Why did I let money cloud my good judgement? Why do I miss that company so much when they don’t seem to miss me at all?</p>

<p>I also feel like one day, someone’s going to figure out I’m a complete fraud. Someone’s going to find out that I don’t really know what I’m doing, that my code sucks, or that there’s really nothing special about the design work I do.</p>

<p>Years ago, I thought these feelings of regret and fraud would go away. That a day comes when you don't care what anyone else says or thinks, you just produce great work, and you're happy. That one day, you don’t seek the validation of others. You don’t care about web traffic, or the praise and/or acceptance of your heroes.</p>

<p>Turns out that, this doesn’t just happen. You have to work at it. As silly as it seems, I’ve had to actively remind myself not to care. I’m constantly having to tell myself that my mistakes don't define me, they inform the person I am. I've had to force myself not to think of the "what-ifs" in life, but to accept that the past cannot be changed, and that the only way to look is forward.</p>

<p><strong>However,</strong> there are moments, where all of these things, that I know to be logically true, go out the window, and we end up where I started this post.</p>

<p>There are moments when, even though I portray to know what I'm doing, I really don't. I have no freaking idea. I'm winging it, and waiting for people to find out.</p>

<p>The job search makes these feelings even stronger. Was I right to quit? Do I just have a huge ego? What if I end up under a bridge somewhere?</p>

<p><strong>So what happens next?</strong></p>

<p>The truth is, I don’t know how to “cure” these feelings. What I do know, is that they won’t stop me. There’s no point in allowing yourself to grow stagnent, you have to keep moving forward, and pushing your own boundaries. Sometimes that’s really scary, but I always think that if it’s not scary, you’re not doing something right.</p>

<p>Vulnerability is frightening, and most people find it to be a weakness. I disagree. Being vulnerable —those moments when you lay everything you’ve got on the table— is when you can truly grow and become a better version of yourself.</p>

<p>I’ll continue to deal with insecurities, but they won’t be calling the shots.</p>

<p>Now, I know that Responsive get's thrown around a lot as a buzz word, but Sam is working with <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a> and <a href="http://paravelinc.com/">Paravel</a> as her unofficial advisory board. It's great to see the support she's received in Austin for teaching her students the right stuff, and I had a blast talking with her.</p>

  <p>If your colleagues, clients, or bosses don’t get why working less is a better idea, leave. There are far better places to be than at a company that values quantity over quality.</p>

<p>I absolutely love articles like this. Actually, I love people who think like this. It's been my experience that working a lot, doesn't mean you're producing a lot. Over time, I've tried to work smart, and try to get more done in a smaller amount of time.</p>

<p>This article hits home a bit closer today as I try to loose weight. Two years have gone by, and I've gained 100 lbs. Why? Because I was so focused on work, I forgot that it's only the means to live my life; <strong>not the reason</strong> to live life.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>First off, I don't like the title of this post. However, it was probably meant to get people interested in the topic, <a href="/articles/silicon-valley-can-suck-it">something I've done before</a>, so I'll let that slide. For a designer, I almost feel like the writer doesn't value the role of his own job.</p>

<p>Copy <em>is not</em> more valuable than design. They are equally important on the web. Without great copy, design fails to do it's job, and likewise, without great design, it doesn't matter how great your copy is.</p>

<p>For the most part, however, I agree with a lot of what he's saying. As designers, we should be good with words. After all, we are responsible for the presentation and effectiveness of a given message.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/looking-back-march-2013">Looking Back: March 2013</a></h2>
          <p>March has gone by in what seems like a blink of an eye. This is what I've been up to.</p>

<p>First off, I'd like to give a shout-out to my pal <a href="http://matt-steele.com">Matt Steele</a> whom gave me this idea. He writes a post at the end of every month, I assume in an effort to document things. Here's <a href="http://matt-steele.com/blog/single/march-2013-in-review">the one he wrote for March</a>.</p>

<h3>Launching Tim Likes to Teach</h3>

<p>At the beginning of March, I was so excited to <a href="/links/my-first-product-launches">launch my first product</a>. <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com">Tim Likes to Teach</a> is a place for anyone to learn Web Design, Front-End Development, WordPress, SCSS, Compass, and so much more.</p>

<p>I launched with one course called <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/courses/design-and-build-an-art-directed-blog/"><em>Design and Build an Art-Directed Blog</em></a>, which is priced at $8. I priced it low on purpose. I wanted as many people as possible to have the ability to purchase it; whether you want to learn a new skill, you're considering a career change, or you're a kid who's only money comes from an allowance.</p>

<h3>The East Wing Nominated for an Award</h3>

<p>This is huge for me. I've never been nominated for anything before, so that y'all thought my show was worthy of this honor is very humbling. It's interesting to see a project which I started more for myself without any intentions of popularity or praise, garnering such.</p>

<p>Whether I win or lose, I love doing that show, and I can't thank those of you who listen enough for all the support and kindness you've shown me. It's a pleasure doing that show, and I hope to do it for a long time.</p>

<p>If you've listened to the show, and you like it, I'd love to have your <a href="http://www.thenetawards.com/">vote</a>.</p>

<h3>New Shows</h3>

<p>I'm also currently working on new shows. I can't say much about them at the moment but, I'm really excited to be planning them. I've had these ideas for quite some time, but I finally feel like I have the time (or I'll make it), and that I can make them a success; more news on this soon.</p>

<p>And that's it. March has been a busy month and it looks like April will be too. Thanks for reading!</p>

          <p>My pal <a href="http://galengidman.com/">Galen Gidman</a> launched the redesign to his podcast, the Young Guns Show. I'm so excited to see him producing shows again. If you're a young person in this industry, and even if you're not, I'm sure you'll like this podcast. It'll inspire you to get your butt into gear and get stuff done.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/launching-version-6">Launching Version 6</a></h2>
          <p>Early last week, I launched version six of this site. I honestly don't know if that version number is correct, because in the early days, I redesigned this site a lot more than I do now; I was sixteen, and procrastinating on my homework.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed, now I just procrastinate on work. Ha!</p>

<p>Anyway, this redesign is a huge one. If you browse the site, you won't see huge content changes. The portfolio is the same, the about page as well. The biggest content change takes place on the contact page with the new form. I'm using <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms</a> to power it.</p>

<p>The form is using conditional logic, and displays different inputs based on what you're contacting me for. I'm hoping that this new form makes it easy for people to get in touch, and encourages people to just say hello. I like getting those types of emails.</p>

<p>You'll notice that this new form also has a speaking engagements option. This is something I'm very interested in pursuing, and again, I hope this new form will facilitate that conversation with conference organizers.</p>

<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

<p>Over the years, I've tried to make it very easy to update the content on this site. I noticed that I came across a lot of links that I wanted to share a bit more "permanently" than just on Twitter. I also noticed that I didn't always have time to flesh out an article, but I wanted to add my thoughts to them. The link and video post formats have been perfect for this.</p>

<p>A huge pain point was the portfolio section. In the past, I'd gotten lots of criticism from potential employers for not having a portfolio. With NDA's, designs not being used, or only participating on parts of projects, I didn't really have much to show. Plus, I wasn't to keen on showing the early crap I had done on my own. Finally, while working at <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a>, I was able to lead two projects that I was very proud of and I created my portfolio.</p>

<p>On the front end, it looked beautiful. I received some very nice compliments of my work and the way I chose to display them. However, on the back end, I was using pages for all of it. Essentially, I had pages nested within pages in WordPress. I had to hack it together, and if I did something incorrectly, the whole thing would break. Plus, I was using a whole bunch of custom fields, and it was just getting out of hand.</p>

<p>I decided it was time to conquer my fear of custom post types and get this done. Now, I'm using a custom post type for the portfolio and Advanced Custom Fields together, and everything is running smoothly and efficiently. If you don't know about custom post types, you should sign up for the <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/">Tim Likes to Teach Newsletter</a>. I'll be covering it in the next course.</p>

<p>The last pain point was the about page. You'll notice that this page contains a list of my interviews and published articles. In the previous version, this was a page template that had been hard coded. Meaning that every time I wanted to add a new article or interview, I had to open up the file, add a new list item, git commit, and push.</p>

<p>I'm now using the <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/">repeater field</a> to handle this. I've created fields for the name of the interview or article, the publishing date, and where it was published, and Advanced Custom Fields and Wordpress takes care of the rest. Easy.</p>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>That's the rundown of the new site. If some of these concepts are new and or difficult for you, please sign up for the Tim Likes to Teach Newsletter. I promise to explain them in an easy way. The docs can sometimes be difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Please take a look around, have a cookie, and let me know what you think.</p>

          <p>This week on The East Wing, I had the chance to talk with Jen Simmons. I'm a huge fan of Jen's podcast, The Web Ahead. I didn't tell her this, but she was one of the inspirations behind me starting The East Wing in the first place. We talked about how she got started, the work that goes into her podcast, and a lot more.</p>

  <p>I’ve distanced myself from past projects; I’ve avoided pushing for the sort of work I really want; I’ve glossed over details to avoid admitting how little I actually know. I’ve worked hard, terribly hard, to make my checklist add up to a good job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such a great thought on The Pastry Box Project by Sara Wachter-Boettcher. I just love her writing. Not to mention, it's incredibly helpful to see someone you admire have a lot of the same nervousness and insecurity with their work. It reminds us that we're all human, and that to a certain extent, we all feel we're figuring it out as we go.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/celebrate-your-achievements">Celebrate Your Achievements</a></h2>
          <p>Just the other day, I noticed that I had been nominated for an <a href="http://www.thenetawards.com/">award</a>. I was nominated alongside some amazing side projects, and quite honestly, I think I have no chance of actually winning. I was hesitant at first to even tell anyone I had been nominated.</p>

<p>When I started <a href="http://theeastwing.net">The East Wing</a>, the objective wasn't to win awards. My only mission is to sit down and create a show better than the week before.</p>

<p>I've come to conclusion, however, that it's really important to celebrate achievements in life. Even being nominated for something like this is huge. Life has a way of bringing you down, and if you don't stop to look at the things you're doing well, it can get pretty depressing. I feel like we focus on how to improve so much, that we can forget about all the awesome we're already accomplishing.</p>

<p>I was raised to be humble; to never brag. My belief is that humility is a necessary quality in life. I don't feel this means we shouldn't celebrate our achievements.</p>

<p>The past six months have been some of the worst of my short life; completely because of my poor decisions. The next six months are going to be better. There's little to nothing I can do about the past, so I'm going to allow myself to be proud of the good things I'm accomplishing and more importantly who I am as a person.</p>

<p>Celebrate your achievements people. Take yourself out somewhere nice. Oh… and pictures, or it didn't happen.</p>
