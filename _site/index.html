          <h2><a href="/articles/moving-over-to-jekyll">Moving Over to Jekyll</a></h2>
          <p>Yes, you read that correctly. I’ve moved this blog over to Jekyll. I don’t know why I didn’t do this sooner.</p>

<p>If you don’t know about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, it’s a static site generator built with Ruby. I was really scared to move over, mostly dreading the work that would go into migrating all of my WordPress posts.  I was able to easily create post formats with the help of some code that my pal <a href="http://avclark.com">Adam Clark</a> pointed me to. </p>

<p>Although it did take me about 8 total hours to migrate and design, I already feel it’s worth it.  I’ve created an Alfred Workflow that allows me to easily create new posts, with the appropriate <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">front-matter</a>, and I’ll be recording a screencast on how to do that in the next couple days. The feed should redirect, but if not, you can grab it <a href="/feed.xml">here</a>. </p>

<p>I know this isn’t a huge thing, but I’m so excited about doing this. I’m even thinking about creating a Tim Likes to Teach course on it. If you’d like to see the source of the site, you can <a href="https://github.com/ttimsmith/ttimsmith.github.com">see it on Github</a>. Feel free to look at the code and submit issues if you see wonky stuff (It’s totally possible. Data migrations aren’t my thing).</p>

<h3 id="so-are-you-anti-wordpress-now">So Are You Anti-WordPress Now?</h3>
<p>Not at all. I love WordPress. I’ve been working with WordPress for years. However, I work on this site a lot, and I found myself very frustrated with how WordPress handles a simple blog. The honest truth, WordPress is too much for just a blog these days. </p>

<p>Using a web editor had become tiresome for me. I like writing posts in Byword. Byword has WordPress publishing support, but no support for post formats, and the process of setting custom fields is not really well done. So in the end, I had to write the post in Byword, and then go to the web editor anyway to set values for the posts. </p>

<p>With Jekyll, I type <code>jekyll  [post-format] [title]</code> in Alfred and a Markdown file is generated and opened for me to begin work. It’s perfect.  Also, the speed of this site has dramatically increased. It’s a thing of beauty. </p>

<p>If you’re considering switching to Jekyll, I really recommend it. It’s not difficult to dive in, and if you’re a fan of optimized workflows, I think you’ll love how time efficient this process is. If you have any questions, let me know, and I’ll try to answer them.</p>

<p>This week, we talk about Time Warner pulling a CBS blackout and then reversing their decision, Netflix setting up viewer accounts within a family, and Marco Arment’s post about what having internet fame gets you in terms of sales in the App Store.</p>

<p>We spend the last half of the show talking through episodes 1 and 2 of Game of Thrones, season 1. Plenty of spoilers abound so you’ve been warned.</p>

<p>This article, beautifully points out the underlying problems of “company culture” these days, which although this piece examines startup culture, really applies to a much larger amount of companies. At least personally, the post describes a lot of the reasons why I’ve stayed far away from the startup scene.</p>

          <p>I’m so happy to announce that my new show, <a href="http://bytesizenews.co">Bytesize</a>, is live! This new show is a labor of love<sup id="fnref-1922:1"><a href="#fn-1922:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I’ve been working on the format for quite some time, and figuring out how the show was going to work, what I was going to report on, and how I’d make it different —and maybe better— from the other news shows out there.</p>

<p>The objective of this show is to update you with the most interesting tech, design, and development news each week, yet only take 5–10 minutes of your time. The broadcast is only one part of the show, since you can receive the news straight to your inbox via the newsletter.</p>

<p>I’ve always wanted to host a news program, and I’m finally getting my chance. I hope you like the new show, and that it's useful for you. I’d love to hear what you think. Thank you so much for listening.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>I’m so happy to let you know that The East Wing received a new coat of paint. For those of you interested in learning how I did this redesign, I made it all into a <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/courses/redesign-a-podcast-website/">Tim Likes to Teach course</a>.</p>

<h3>What Has Changed</h3>

<p>There were a quite a few problems I had with the old site, and I feel like these have been addressed with this new design.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>No More Truncated Titles</strong><br />
A lot of people complained about the truncated titles. I totally agree with this, and in fact, I’ve completely changed the episode naming convention to just the name of the guest. Before, I was trying to do a clever title, but I felt it just wasn’t working with the type of show The East Wing is. </li>
<li><strong>Better Typography</strong><br />
I didn’t really like the type of the previous site. In some cases, I felt it was too big, and often overpowering. The new type is so much nicer, and works well on the whole site, instead of just the episode pages like the previous design.</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on the Guest</strong><br />
The old design had a picture of the guest on the index page. This new design also has the picture on the episode page. It’s a small detail, but I like the fact that you can always associate the voice with a face.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Back-end Capabilities</strong><br />
Like I’ve said before, when redesigning a site like this, it’s so important to improve the publishing workflow. I created a new custom post type for the new <a href="http://theeastwing.net/offair">Off Air</a> show, and added an easy way to link each Off Air episode with its corresponding East Wing episode.</li>
<li><strong>Better Forms</strong><br />
In the past, the forms on the <a href="#">Contact</a> and <a href="#">Sponsorship</a> pages were created from some snippets I’d found. <strong>They sucked</strong>. The forms are now powered by <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com">Gravity Forms</a> and allow for some awesome features.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m so proud of this new design, and I hope you like it too. If you listen to the show live, I think you’ll like some new improvements on the front as well. I’d love to hear what you think of the new design.</p>

<p>When Apple announced iOS 7 at WWDC, there was a lot of —in my opinion— unnecessary and premature backlash. Nobody had used it, and the whole WWDC keynote aftermath, was one of the greatest examples of <span style="color: #aaa;">#firstworldproblems</span>.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, were people whom I greatly respect, yet seemed to be blind to the obvious issues with the new OS.<sup id="fnref-1596:1"><a href="#fn-1596:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I’ve been using iOS 7 for about three weeks now, and I stand by my statement that it’s a great foundation for developers to build on. There are a lot of new interactions which seem logical, and you can feel the attention to detail in some areas. I’m positive that designers and developers are working hard to implement the new look and feel, in a way that works well for their applications.</p>

<p>However, the apps made by Apple are extremely rough around the edges, and a lot of the new aesthetics are downright horrible. Accessibility is an issue in many places, and I’m worried to hear the reaction of my color-blind father, whom I spent most of my adolescent life convincing, that Apple was the pinnacle of design.</p>

<p>For years, iOS has been the best mobile operating system, and the easiest to learn. Babies and the elderly alike, knew how to use it. I fear this is no longer the case.</p>

<p>I wonder whether my opinion is clouded by human’s natural opposition to change, although I find this highly unlikely.  What’s worse, is that this whole thing has <a href="/links/apple-applies-for-iwatch-trademark">made me skeptical</a> —and I’m sure others as well— on the future of Apple and the quality of its products.</p>

<p><strong>My message to Apple is this:</strong></p>

<p>You know I love you. I’ve managed to convince most of the people in my life to buy your products, but you can do better than this. You are not the company influenced by the trends of others, you set them. Get your act together, and make the amazing products I know you can make.</p>

<p>This is so exciting. I think Tim Cook made it clear that Apple was interested in this space. However, after iOS 7, I’m skeptical on how well this thing will look and work. I really hope Apple proves me wrong.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/a-new-rss-setup">A New RSS Setup</a></h2>
          <p>July is upon us, and if you forgot to export your feeds out of Google Reader, you have about 6 hours to do it. Come tomorrow, Google Reader will shut down, and an a new era of RSS will begin.</p>

<p>Chris and I talked about alternatives on <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/tltb/do-we-really-want-to-go-back-to-aol/">this week’s Too Lazy to Blog</a>, but at the time, I hadn’t chosen where I’d go. However, I spent yesterday doing some research and I’d love to share my new setup with you.</p>

<h3>Powering the Backend</h3>

<p>There are quite a few choices out there at this point. The problem is that the integrations aren’t great. <a href="http://cloud.feedly.com/">Feedly</a> for example, seems to have a lot of support, but it’s free and I decided early on that I wanted to pay for the service. This way, the likeliness of the service disappearing is smaller.</p>

<p>I decided on <a href="http://feedwrangler.net/welcome.html">Feed Wrangler</a>. I’ve heard some very good things about the service, as well as the developer behind it. Also, it has a pretty cool bookmarklet for you to instantly subscribe to a feed. The UI isn&#8217;t great, but I just need it to power the syncing. I almost never visit the actual site.</p>

<h3>Apps</h3>

<p>I’d previously been using <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. However, only their iPhone app integrates with any of these new services, and there’s no word on when exactly the iPad and Mac apps will follow. Personally, I don’t really enjoy reading on my phone or on my Mac, so it was important to find a service that integrated with a great iPad app.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/">Mr. Reader</a>. Creepy icon aside, the app is really nice. You can customize the reading experience a lot more than Reeder, and the sharing actually works. It has Readability, Twitter, App.net, and Kippt integration which is perfect for me. If you need more than that, have no fear, the app has many different choices.</p>

<p>If you also need a Mac app, I’m most likely going to go with <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a>. Again, integrations look great, and the customization of the reading experience is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that helps. Let me know if you’ve found alternate solutions. I’d love to hear about them. Happy reading!</p>

          <p>This week: Adam is away with a sick household so Tim and Chris hold down the fort and talk through 30/30, a time management app, Google Reader’s imminent death, sidebars and blog design, Discovery asking for more money and is Orphan Black the best show on TV?</p>

<p>We’re taking a two week break, and we’ll be re-launching the show with an all new name, artwork, and more! Stay tuned!</p>
