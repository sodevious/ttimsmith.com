          <p>Today was the quite the interesting day. I'm officially the owner of Anythin' Goes LLC. I'm a business owner and that freaks me out.</p>

<h3>The Reason Behind the Name</h3>

<p>I chose Anythin’ Goes because I want it to be the parent company over my different projects. I'm not only doing design work, I host a <a href="http://theeastwing.net">podcast</a> and soon (hopefully) I'll be publishing a <a href="http://makeaweso.me">magazine</a>. </p>

<p>I don't know exactly what lies in the future for me or the company but I'm excited to find out and I hope you'll come along for the ride. I think this is all for the best. I feel like finally things are turning around and I'm headed in a good direction, both in my life and career.</p>

<p>I'm so excited to announce that we launched the Kickstarter campaign for <a href="http://makeaweso.me">Make Awesome</a> today! I've shot and reshot the video tons of times and finally I had to just be happy with it. I've been doing a lot of behind the scenes work and I'm anxious to see if people believe in the idea as much as I do.</p>

<p>At the moment, we already have some amazing contributors like <a href="https://twitter.com/higley">John Higley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Eecho13084">Abby Barlok</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Spentacular">Spencer Hamm</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jglovier">Joel Glovier</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/eaton">Jeff Eaton</a> and more to come.

          <h2><a href="/articles/the-thoughts-of-someone-who-shouldnt-be-awake">The Thoughts of Someone Who Shouldn’t Be Awake</a></h2>
          <p>I've been working a lot and very hard on my new freelancing business and the magazine. I have the “letter to the editor” layout finished and the “intro to the interview” layout finished as well. I am so nervous. I wonder if all this work will be in vain. I wonder if this idea will fail. I wonder if I'm the right person to execute this idea. I worry that this could turn into a disaster. I read earlier today a great quote from <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a> on <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/jason-santa-maria">The Great Discontent</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m sure that I’m romanticizing it as I’m getting older, but when you’re a kid, everything seems possible. When you think about doing something, the time between thinking about doing it and actually doing it is usually very brief. You say, “Hey, what if I do that?” and then you’re doing it. As an adult, you think, “I want to do this thing,” or, “I want to make something.” Then you start gathering resources and devising a plan, but then you get tired because you’re old and want to lay down. There’s something about that childhood idiocy that I often think back on and love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with him. As we get older we tend to think a lot more about the decisions we make. Interestingly, for personal things, I've always been carefree to the point of making some very bad decisions. With work, however, I'd say that most if not all of my decisions have been conservative. I tend to do things that I'm comfortable with; things I know. It's because of this that I believe this magazine is so hugely important to me. It's a risk. A huge risk on my part. I'm hoping for the best but being realistic about the possibility of utter failure. Either way, I'm convinced that something can be learned from this experience. I've already learned so much about editorial layout for print and I'm excited at the opportunity to call this product mine.</p>

<p>Maybe these thoughts belong in my personal journal but, I just want to say to those of you who are thinking of taking risky decisions, do it. Jump in. I was so scared to leave the comfort of a full-time job and yet, here I am, with enough money to eat and to have a roof over my head. Take a risk. Work on what you've wanted to do. It's scary as all hell but, can be immensely rewarding and educational.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/progress-on-make-awesome">Progress on Make Awesome</a></h2>
          <img src="/uploads/2012/10/ma1-hero.png" alt="Layout Preview" />

<p>So this a quick update on Make Awesome. I've started to set deadlines for myself so that I actually start getting things done. My Kickstarter video will be up this week come hell or high water. I'd love to see how much interest there is around the idea. For me, it'd be a dream come true to get this published and in the hands of people.</p>

<p>I've chosen the typefaces for the project, which will be <a href="http://www.bariol.com/">Bariol</a>, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/skolar/">Skolar</a> and <a href="http://pictos.cc/font/">Pictos</a> for the icons. I've worked with Skolar before on the web and it's a beautiful typeface that works very well with extended copy. Bariol is also a beautiful typeface and gives the publication and formal yet casual feel at the same time. Pictos is also a great icon font designed by <a href="http://drewwilson.com/">Drew Wilson</a> that has the style I was going for.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see a layout I had worked on, you should <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/750642-Progress">look at this</a>. I've changed the layout of it already but, the color and style is pretty defined. It's interesting how I've been creating online editorial environments for most of my career yet I've had to learn how to create one for print. The whole mentality is different. Leave a comment with your thoughts on the layout!</p>

          <p>So as I said earlier today, my time at <a href="http://andyet.net">&amp;yet</a> has ended. I really liked the team and enjoyed my time there but they're looking for someone that is more developer oriented. In fact, if you're looking for a front-end position, you should check them out. They're a great team and I appreciate everything they've done for me.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I'll be looking for freelance work or a full-time position. If you know of anything or you have a web project you'd like me to work on, <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>! I'd love to talk.</p>

          <p>I had been talking with <a href="http://www.jannahagan.com/">Janna</a> about writing for her blog since June. I had been so busy that I just didn't have the time to sit down and write something (or maybe it was lack of inspiration? I don't know). Finally, last week I sat down and was able to write close to 800 words on <em>setting yourself up right</em>. I'm really happy and excited about this article.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/always-changing-things-up">Always Changing Things Up</a></h2>
          <p>What a shock that this site got another refresh right? Well, I'm happy to push this new design out. I've been learning a lot in the past couple of weeks and one of those things is SCSS. I can't believe I hadn't used this in my daily workflow before. I was introduced to it at the beginning of this year by my pal <a href="https://twitter.com/kenearley">Ken Earley</a>. It wasn't until recently that I've been working with it more closely and I'm amazed at how much time you can save by using it. I'll be creating a screencast later this week to show you some of the power of SCSS.</p>

<p>Anyway, this new site is built with more semantic code (I'm trying to use elements like <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code> and <code>article</code>) and SCSS. I also think the new design is a lot cleaner and easy to read.</p>

<p>Honestly though, there have been a lot of changes recently, both personally and professionally. Some have been good and others have been bad. It's been tough to deal with some of the mistakes I've made recently but, I chose not to focus on the negative. I want to focus on the positive; how I can make better decisions moving forward and see the benefits of these soon. This is a lot more mushy than I normally am on here but, to sum up, I'm confident that I'm now headed in the right direction and things are looking very bright.</p>

          <p>I got the chance to record with <a href="http://www.thisisaaronslife.com/">Aaron Irizarry</a> and <a href="http://adamconnor.com/">Adam Connor</a>. It was a really awesome conversation about design critique and was über educational for me and I hope it is for you too.</p>

          <blockquote>
  <p>Hey Tim,</p>
  <p>Just wanted to say I love your show. I'm a newer web designer (1.5 years) and former tv news videojournalist so I got to work with a lot of reporters and conduct a lot of interviews as well. From both angles you do a great job of getting guests to open up and share their knowledge and experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This morning, I woke up to that email. It made my day. This is not an effort to inflate my ego. What made my day was that he is finding my rinky-dink show useful. He's enjoying the guests and it's my hope that the show is helping him learn a thing or two in his new industry.</p>

<p>For me, it just drills home that if you're nice and you work hard, great things happen. The show has helped me personally in so many ways and I'm so glad it helps others too.</p>

          <p>I sat down with <a href="http://samsoff.es/">Sam Soffes</a>, the creator of <a href="https://cheddarapp.com/">Cheddar</a>. It was awesome! Sam is a real down to earth guy. We talk about Cheddar, retiring at 25 and his consulting rate among other things.</p>

          <p>I <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/22-sam">interviewed Sam</a> earlier this week and even before that, I was a big fan of <a href="https://cheddarapp.com/">Cheddar</a>. Today, he announced the Mac app for Cheddar and it's amazingly beautiful! The UI Sam has created for the brand is really nice and the pricing is ridiculously affordable. Check it out and download the app <a href="https://cheddarapp.com/mac">here</a>!</p>
