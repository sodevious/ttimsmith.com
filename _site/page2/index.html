          <h2><a href="/articles/a-new-rss-setup">A New RSS Setup</a></h2>
          <p>July is upon us, and if you forgot to export your feeds out of Google Reader, you have about 6 hours to do it. Come tomorrow, Google Reader will shut down, and an a new era of RSS will begin.</p>

<p>Chris and I talked about alternatives on <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/tltb/do-we-really-want-to-go-back-to-aol/">this week’s Too Lazy to Blog</a>, but at the time, I hadn’t chosen where I’d go. However, I spent yesterday doing some research and I’d love to share my new setup with you.</p>

<h3>Powering the Backend</h3>

<p>There are quite a few choices out there at this point. The problem is that the integrations aren’t great. <a href="http://cloud.feedly.com/">Feedly</a> for example, seems to have a lot of support, but it’s free and I decided early on that I wanted to pay for the service. This way, the likeliness of the service disappearing is smaller.</p>

<p>I decided on <a href="http://feedwrangler.net/welcome.html">Feed Wrangler</a>. I’ve heard some very good things about the service, as well as the developer behind it. Also, it has a pretty cool bookmarklet for you to instantly subscribe to a feed. The UI isn&#8217;t great, but I just need it to power the syncing. I almost never visit the actual site.</p>

<h3>Apps</h3>

<p>I’d previously been using <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. However, only their iPhone app integrates with any of these new services, and there’s no word on when exactly the iPad and Mac apps will follow. Personally, I don’t really enjoy reading on my phone or on my Mac, so it was important to find a service that integrated with a great iPad app.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="http://www.curioustimes.de/mrreader/">Mr. Reader</a>. Creepy icon aside, the app is really nice. You can customize the reading experience a lot more than Reeder, and the sharing actually works. It has Readability, Twitter, App.net, and Kippt integration which is perfect for me. If you need more than that, have no fear, the app has many different choices.</p>

<p>If you also need a Mac app, I’m most likely going to go with <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a>. Again, integrations look great, and the customization of the reading experience is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that helps. Let me know if you’ve found alternate solutions. I’d love to hear about them. Happy reading!</p>

  <p>But when we only promote our shiniest pieces, we don’t really build confidence. We build shallowness. We start measuring our work in terms of the fame we get out of it, rather than the heart we put into it. We start mistaking praise for progress, and we take projects or jobs that look good on paper (or balance sheets), but do little to help us learn and grow.</p>

<p>I’ve told Sara she’s one of my favorite writers, and a piece likes this just makes me like her more. I admire writing that is able to expose the true self, and I hope that one day, I can be this vulnerable with my writing.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/tim-likes-to-teach-gets-a-redesign-2">Tim Likes to Teach Get’s a Redesign</a></h2>
          <p>Today, I launched the new <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com">Tim Likes to Teach</a>. This redesign has been in the works for about three months. Not a huge amount of time, but considering that when I started, it was only supposed to be a minor update, it ended up taking quite a while.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very proud of this new design, and if you&#8217;re an existing customer, I think you’re going to love it. The old site had quite a bit of pain points, and I think this new design addresses them very well.</p>

<p>The beauty of this redesign is, I’ve improved the back-end to make it easy to add new courses and videos. I&#8217;m new using a custom post type for courses and course videos, then connecting them with a plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/">Posts to Posts</a>. </p>

<p>The experience has greatly improved on the front-end too. In the past, videos were on a page and some couldn’t even find them. <strong>It was totally my fault</strong>. When I first designed the site, the plan was to have you download all the video files, so the design didn&#8217;t work when that plan didn&#8217;t work. </p>

<p>Now, I feel the site has a good flow to it. Breadcrumbs do a good job of helping you remember where you are, and give quick access to the course homepage. </p>

<h3>A New Course</h3>

<p>As promised, I’ve started to post videos for the new course “Redesign a Podcast Website”. Lots of people have showed interest in this project since there are some interesting design and development problems to solve.</p>

<p>This course is currently in progress, and I&#8217;m recording and adding new videos everyday.</p>

<h3>A New Business Model</h3>

<p>As most of you know, I&#8217;m now <a href="http://ttimsmith.com/articles/the-future-of-tim-smith">full-time on my own projects</a>, so I&#8217;m looking for ways to generate enough income to sustain myself. With that in mind, Tim Likes to Teach has moved to a subscription model. </p>

<p>For only $8.99/month, you get access to all courses and respective downloads. There is a formal plan for future courses, and I&#8217;m already doing pre-production on these.</p>

<p>Again, I hope you love this new design. As always, my goal remains the same: to help people learn the web with their friendly internet pal, me. </p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/its-not-that-complicated">It’s Not That Complicated</a></h2>
          <p>When I first got into this industry, things were a lot simpler. We didn’t worry about designing responsively, and there were no “mobile strategies”.</p>

<p>The iPhone hadn’t even come out yet. My workflow consisted of designing in Photoshop, slicing the design into tons of PNG’s, and coding all of this up in Dreamweaver.<sup id="fnref-1511:1"><a href="#fn-1511:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I’m glad we’ve come so far in the past years. I feel like we’ve collectively improved the web a lot. People involved in web projects are thinking about process, strategy, user experience, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Yet, for graduating students, or anyone else barely entering our industry, I can see how it could seem overwhelming. Every day, there seems to be a new technology we should be learning, or articles explaining something we’re not paying attention to. Job postings don’t really help. A lot of these postings use big words, and the whole hiring process can be very intimidating.</p>

<p>As someone who’s been in his fair share of interviews, don’t let these intimidate you. Every time I started a new job, I’d get nervous that I wouldn’t be able to do it. Yet, I’ve learned that the web can be complicated, but if you’re hard working and eager to learn, everything else can be taught.</p>

<p>So if you’re feeling stressed, take a break. Think about something else. When you get back, try your best. That’s really the only thing you can be asked for.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/overcoming-yourself">Overcoming Yourself</a></h2>
          <p>Writing for me, is one of those things I wish I could be great at. I can read pieces by other people, and be moved, inspired, motivated, and more with a single paragraph. Great writers are able to convey emotion and tell a story while keeping you interested with every word.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I've told myself that I can't write. I've noticed that I have the power to hold myself back, if I don't fight against the urge to talk myself out of things. If I want to be a great writer, what better way than to practice a little everyday?</p>

<p><strong>That’s exactly what I’m doing.</strong></p>

<p>I'm tired of telling myself I can't do something; that's the world's job. I can't draw, I can't play piano, I can't be fit, etc; it's rubbish. I can do all those things. The only thing in the way is <strong>me</strong>.</p>

<p>It's quite an interesting moment when you realize the biggest hurdle to overcome is your own cynicism; that's ridiculous. If anything, you should be rooting for your own self.</p>

<p>I give up on trying to stop myself from doing something I really want; you could be on the edge of greatness and not realize it.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/on-redesigns">On Redesigns</a></h2>
          <p>What is the point of redesigning something? What's trying to be accomplished? Whether it be an app, website, or any type of product, clear goals are behind necessary redesigns.</p>

<p>When clients have come to me in the past to redesign their website or brand, the first question out of my mouth, is why. Often, people have an idea of what they're trying to accomplish:  they want more customers, they'd like to provide current users with a better experience, they'd like to create a future-friendly website, etc.</p>

<p>Redesigning for the sake of change is limited to personal sites. This should never be a strategy where the user experience is actually important.</p>

<p>As designers, it's necessary we think these things through. Too many people believe that design is purely visual, and sometimes, we contribute to that incorrect assumption. The reality is, design is heavily reliant on asking the right questions, and properly analyzing the answers.</p>

<p>When we do this, we can create designs that improve an experience, and possibly improve the lives of our users.</p>

          <p>This week, I had the chance to talk with my friend Adam Stacoviak. Adam is a Designer, Developer, and Broadcaster. We talked about building products. They're not easy to create or maintain, and sometimes you have to make tough decisions.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/make-your-own-club">Make Your Own Club</a></h2>
          <p>I've never felt like I belong to a club. In school, I wasn't popular, I didn't play sports, nor was I a good student. I didn't really fit in.</p>

<p>For most of my school years, it bothered me. I became a person I wasn't, just to be accepted. It wasn't until the final years of high school that I realized I could just be myself, and not care. I could find friends who liked me for me.</p>

<p>In a certain way, this type of thing continues in work and on the web. The popular people and the ones who aren't. Unlike high school, the popular kids are mostly really nice. However, I've noticed that I —and many others— continue wanting to be part of the club.</p>

<p><strong>What is “the club” anyways?</strong></p>

<p>What we sometimes forget is that there are lots of clubs, and being active on the web is as easy as reaching out. If you don't seem to find one that suits you, make one. Create a place where you feel comfortable and can be edifying to others.</p>

<p>Being friends with big names isn't what makes you awesome, being kind and respectful does. You can't give people too much importance; sometimes, even your heroes will let you down. Time spent resenting is time not spent on doing great work.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>This interview in a lot of ways is ridiculous. Walt and Kara went a bit to the extreme in trying not to show any bias towards Apple, and instead were a bit harsh. Although, I can understand how difficult it must be to conduct an objective and unbiased interview with the CEO of arguably the best technology company at the moment.</p>

<p>Tim seems very confident in Apple and it's future, and why wouldn't he? Their stock price has nothing to do with the success Apple has reached, nor does it say anything about the legacy they've already created for themselves. Anyone who follows Apple knows that they're working on something big, and their silence only guarantees that.</p>
