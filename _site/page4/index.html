          <h2><a href="/articles/celebrate-your-achievements">Celebrate Your Achievements</a></h2>
          <p>Just the other day, I noticed that I had been nominated for an <a href="http://www.thenetawards.com/">award</a>. I was nominated alongside some amazing side projects, and quite honestly, I think I have no chance of actually winning. I was hesitant at first to even tell anyone I had been nominated.</p>

<p>When I started <a href="http://theeastwing.net">The East Wing</a>, the objective wasn't to win awards. My only mission is to sit down and create a show better than the week before.</p>

<p>I've come to conclusion, however, that it's really important to celebrate achievements in life. Even being nominated for something like this is huge. Life has a way of bringing you down, and if you don't stop to look at the things you're doing well, it can get pretty depressing. I feel like we focus on how to improve so much, that we can forget about all the awesome we're already accomplishing.</p>

<p>I was raised to be humble; to never brag. My belief is that humility is a necessary quality in life. I don't feel this means we shouldn't celebrate our achievements.</p>

<p>The past six months have been some of the worst of my short life; completely because of my poor decisions. The next six months are going to be better. There's little to nothing I can do about the past, so I'm going to allow myself to be proud of the good things I'm accomplishing and more importantly who I am as a person.</p>

<p>Celebrate your achievements people. Take yourself out somewhere nice. Oh… and pictures, or it didn't happen.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Yesterday was an exciting day for me. I launched my first product. I might add, that I took my own advice and charged for it from the beginning, which is something I'm also very excited about.</p>

<p>I've been working hard for a couple of months to create an introductory course for <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/">Tim Likes To Teach</a>. When I say introductory, I don't mean in skill level. It's introductory in the sense that it will acquaint you with the site, the type of content and perks that come with each course. This course is a six-part series that spans more than six hours of content. It covers best practices in HTML, CSS and more. We cover the markup necessary for the design, yet we also talk about <em>why</em> we mark it up in that way. At least in my experience, that has so much value.</p>

<p>In the future, I'll be creating other courses. You might have heard that one of these will feature a complete redesign of <a href="http://theeastwing.net/">The East Wing</a>. I hope you'll subscribe to the newsletter so you're always in the know of the latest course. To those of you who purchased the first series, or if you plan to, my sincerest of thank you's.</p>

<p>If there is something you'd like to learn about, I hope you'll let me know!</p>

          <p>Last week, I was asked to be on Show Me Your Mic. It's a podcast that talks to other podcasters about their setup and the story behind the shows. For me, it's a lot of fun because we talk about so much more than gear (which in my case isn't the coolest setup ever). If you're interested in podcasting or want to start a podcast of your own, I'm sure you'll like this show.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/the-coffee-shop-hypothesis">The Coffee Shop Hypothesis</a></h2>
          <p>Today, I decided to leave my home office and work at the local coffee shop. This is the second time in the past two weeks that I've done this and I've come to a realization: although I spend less time working, I'm producing more.</p>

<p>I really like working remote but, in recent months, being away from the family, I've noticed that my love for it has decreased. I don't see many people during the day and it feels kind of blue. But, I've noticed that the days I go out to the coffee shop or make a lunch plans, are much better days for me. I produce more and generally feel happier about the day.</p>

<p>Have you felt something similar? Do you work from a co-working place? A coffee shop? Or do you like only working from home?</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was asked by James, the Editor of The Branch, to write an article about this simple question: What inspires you? I've always had a difficult time responding to that question but, I feel the article does a good job of exploring what my answer is. Hope you find my thoughts useful.</p>

<p>About a month ago, my buddie Josh Long asked if anyone was interested in contributing to the Treehouse blog. Since I have a constant need to feel &amp; sound smart, I jumped at the chance! Today, my first article went live. I talk about some things I've picked up related to the business of design.</p>

<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>

          <p>I'm so very pleased to let you all know that Make Awesome is now Lustra Magazine. If you recall, back in October I launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timothybsmith/make-awesome-magazine">Kickstarter project</a> to fund this magazine. I did a horrible video, priced the magazine too high and the project was unsuccessfully funded.</p>

<p>However, I noticed that people loved the idea; they loved the idea of a magazine about people making great things. It is the magazine for and about the underdogs; the people that don't always get the spotlight they deserve. This is definitely a message I could identify with and many others too.</p>

<p><strong>I decided to keep this idea going.</strong></p>

<p>After lots of internal debate, I decided to rename the magazine Lustra. In Spanish, the word "lustre" means to give polish or shine. I felt that this word resonated with the mission I was on with this publication. I changed a letter so it would be a bit easier to pronounce in English and bam! Lustra Magazine was born.</p>

<p>I'm really excited about what's coming and we're very close to confirming the fourth and final interviewee for this issue. I'd like to give a huge thanks to <a href="http://jarederondu.com/">Jared Erondu</a> for assuring me that I had chosen a great new name and for all the help he's given me throughout this project. I'd also like to give thanks to everyone who's been following along, for your support and kind words. I appreciate it so much.</p>

          <p>This week on The East Wing, I had a chance to talk with Trent Walton. Trent is the guy behind the awesome art directed articles on his <a href="http://trentwalton.com">personal site</a> and is one-third of <a href="http://paravelinc.com/">Paravel</a>. He's a really great guy and it was nice chatting about how he got into design and the early troubles of Paravel.</p>
