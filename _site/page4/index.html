          <h2><a href="/articles/launching-version-6">Launching Version 6</a></h2>
          <p>Early last week, I launched version six of this site. I honestly don't know if that version number is correct, because in the early days, I redesigned this site a lot more than I do now; I was sixteen, and procrastinating on my homework.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed, now I just procrastinate on work. Ha!</p>

<p>Anyway, this redesign is a huge one. If you browse the site, you won't see huge content changes. The portfolio is the same, the about page as well. The biggest content change takes place on the contact page with the new form. I'm using <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms</a> to power it.</p>

<p>The form is using conditional logic, and displays different inputs based on what you're contacting me for. I'm hoping that this new form makes it easy for people to get in touch, and encourages people to just say hello. I like getting those types of emails.</p>

<p>You'll notice that this new form also has a speaking engagements option. This is something I'm very interested in pursuing, and again, I hope this new form will facilitate that conversation with conference organizers.</p>

<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

<p>Over the years, I've tried to make it very easy to update the content on this site. I noticed that I came across a lot of links that I wanted to share a bit more "permanently" than just on Twitter. I also noticed that I didn't always have time to flesh out an article, but I wanted to add my thoughts to them. The link and video post formats have been perfect for this.</p>

<p>A huge pain point was the portfolio section. In the past, I'd gotten lots of criticism from potential employers for not having a portfolio. With NDA's, designs not being used, or only participating on parts of projects, I didn't really have much to show. Plus, I wasn't to keen on showing the early crap I had done on my own. Finally, while working at <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a>, I was able to lead two projects that I was very proud of and I created my portfolio.</p>

<p>On the front end, it looked beautiful. I received some very nice compliments of my work and the way I chose to display them. However, on the back end, I was using pages for all of it. Essentially, I had pages nested within pages in WordPress. I had to hack it together, and if I did something incorrectly, the whole thing would break. Plus, I was using a whole bunch of custom fields, and it was just getting out of hand.</p>

<p>I decided it was time to conquer my fear of custom post types and get this done. Now, I'm using a custom post type for the portfolio and Advanced Custom Fields together, and everything is running smoothly and efficiently. If you don't know about custom post types, you should sign up for the <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/">Tim Likes to Teach Newsletter</a>. I'll be covering it in the next course.</p>

<p>The last pain point was the about page. You'll notice that this page contains a list of my interviews and published articles. In the previous version, this was a page template that had been hard coded. Meaning that every time I wanted to add a new article or interview, I had to open up the file, add a new list item, git commit, and push.</p>

<p>I'm now using the <a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/">repeater field</a> to handle this. I've created fields for the name of the interview or article, the publishing date, and where it was published, and Advanced Custom Fields and Wordpress takes care of the rest. Easy.</p>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>That's the rundown of the new site. If some of these concepts are new and or difficult for you, please sign up for the Tim Likes to Teach Newsletter. I promise to explain them in an easy way. The docs can sometimes be difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Please take a look around, have a cookie, and let me know what you think.</p>

          <p>This week on The East Wing, I had the chance to talk with Jen Simmons. I'm a huge fan of Jen's podcast, The Web Ahead. I didn't tell her this, but she was one of the inspirations behind me starting The East Wing in the first place. We talked about how she got started, the work that goes into her podcast, and a lot more.</p>

  <p>I’ve distanced myself from past projects; I’ve avoided pushing for the sort of work I really want; I’ve glossed over details to avoid admitting how little I actually know. I’ve worked hard, terribly hard, to make my checklist add up to a good job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such a great thought on The Pastry Box Project by Sara Wachter-Boettcher. I just love her writing. Not to mention, it's incredibly helpful to see someone you admire have a lot of the same nervousness and insecurity with their work. It reminds us that we're all human, and that to a certain extent, we all feel we're figuring it out as we go.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/celebrate-your-achievements">Celebrate Your Achievements</a></h2>
          <p>Just the other day, I noticed that I had been nominated for an <a href="http://www.thenetawards.com/">award</a>. I was nominated alongside some amazing side projects, and quite honestly, I think I have no chance of actually winning. I was hesitant at first to even tell anyone I had been nominated.</p>

<p>When I started <a href="http://theeastwing.net">The East Wing</a>, the objective wasn't to win awards. My only mission is to sit down and create a show better than the week before.</p>

<p>I've come to conclusion, however, that it's really important to celebrate achievements in life. Even being nominated for something like this is huge. Life has a way of bringing you down, and if you don't stop to look at the things you're doing well, it can get pretty depressing. I feel like we focus on how to improve so much, that we can forget about all the awesome we're already accomplishing.</p>

<p>I was raised to be humble; to never brag. My belief is that humility is a necessary quality in life. I don't feel this means we shouldn't celebrate our achievements.</p>

<p>The past six months have been some of the worst of my short life; completely because of my poor decisions. The next six months are going to be better. There's little to nothing I can do about the past, so I'm going to allow myself to be proud of the good things I'm accomplishing and more importantly who I am as a person.</p>

<p>Celebrate your achievements people. Take yourself out somewhere nice. Oh… and pictures, or it didn't happen.</p>

          <p>Yesterday was an exciting day for me. I launched my first product. I might add, that I took my own advice and charged for it from the beginning, which is something I'm also very excited about.</p>

<p>I've been working hard for a couple of months to create an introductory course for <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/">Tim Likes To Teach</a>. When I say introductory, I don't mean in skill level. It's introductory in the sense that it will acquaint you with the site, the type of content and perks that come with each course. This course is a six-part series that spans more than six hours of content. It covers best practices in HTML, CSS and more. We cover the markup necessary for the design, yet we also talk about <em>why</em> we mark it up in that way. At least in my experience, that has so much value.</p>

<p>In the future, I'll be creating other courses. You might have heard that one of these will feature a complete redesign of <a href="http://theeastwing.net/">The East Wing</a>. I hope you'll subscribe to the newsletter so you're always in the know of the latest course. To those of you who purchased the first series, or if you plan to, my sincerest of thank you's.</p>

<p>If there is something you'd like to learn about, I hope you'll let me know!</p>

For me, it's a lot of fun because we talk about so much more than gear (which in my case isn't the coolest setup ever). If you're interested in podcasting or want to start a podcast of your own, I'm sure you'll like this show.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/the-coffee-shop-hypothesis">The Coffee Shop Hypothesis</a></h2>
          <p>Today, I decided to leave my home office and work at the local coffee shop. This is the second time in the past two weeks that I've done this and I've come to a realization: although I spend less time working, I'm producing more.</p>

<p>I really like working remote but, in recent months, being away from the family, I've noticed that my love for it has decreased. I don't see many people during the day and it feels kind of blue. But, I've noticed that the days I go out to the coffee shop or make a lunch plans, are much better days for me. I produce more and generally feel happier about the day.</p>

<p>Have you felt something similar? Do you work from a co-working place? A coffee shop? Or do you like only working from home?</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was asked by James, the Editor of The Branch, to write an article about this simple question: What inspires you?

          <p>You might’ve noticed that I published an <a href="http://timothybsmith.com/links/my-article-on-the-treehouse-blog">article on the Treehouse Blog</a> about business. My friends over at Pagebreak invited me to be on their show and talk about it. I’m usually having to worry about everything working properly during a recording but, this time, all I had to do was show up. It was so fun!</p>
