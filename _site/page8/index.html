          <p>Hi Everyone! So I deleted the old feed and created a new one. Why? The old one had ads on it back when I believed in “monetizing” everything (I was so stupid). The problem was, I couldn’t delete the ads anymore. I had done some type of intricate who-knows-what and was now stuck. The only way out was to delete the feed and start fresh so that’s what I did. You can now subscribe to the new feed <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/timothybsmith">here</a> or with the RSS link above. As always, thanks for reading!</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Today I've launched version three of The East Wing theme. I'm excited. I'm excited not only because of the new design (tons of improvements have been made), I'm also excited because of the great attention the show has received and the people that it's helped. When I first started the show, I wanted to learn from people who are much smarter than me. I wanted to find out whatever information I could get so that I could improve. I've learned a lot in the last six months and I'm finally on the way to becoming the designer I want to be.</p>

<p>It makes me happy to see how people have really enjoyed the show. Personally, I've always had a love for broadcasting so this show was a perfect merge of two great passions of mine: broadcasting and design. Even if no one would've ever listened, I would've continued on but, I can't explain how amazing it is to see that the show helps people with their work and inspires them.</p>

<p>The East Wing has some very exciting times on the horizon. I've gotten into a good grove and people enjoy the guests we talk to. If you haven't already, I invite you to listen to the show and take a peek at the new design. I hope it makes the experience better for you when listening and looking for episodes. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support.</p>

<p>This is such an awesome answer. I feel like we can be quick to give or offer solutions to problems when we haven't actually done the research. As designers, we need to stick to our process and make sure it's in place in every project we work on. It's the only way we can truly solve problems.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/i-put-comments-on-my-site">I Put Comments on My Site</a></h2>
          <p>Yup. That's right. I put comments on here. I'm actually kind of excited about it. Jason Van Lue wrote a great small post the other day on <a href="http://journal.jasonvanlue.com/post/26438772365/write">writing</a>. He's a new guy I've been following after his great talk at the Front-End Design Conference. The part I found especially interesting was this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this digital age not only is it incredibly easy to put the proverbial pen to paper, but the barrier for ‘acceptable’ writing is much lower. It’s a time where 140 characters is the norm, so don’t hesitate just because you’re not the ‘best writer’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me, that's always been what stops me. There are a myriad of more talented and skilled writers than me. Hell, they could probably express what I'm thinking better than my own self. Yet, I've seen that writing is therapeutic and in fact, gets me to delve deeper into topics and really think about them on another level.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is a really long way of saying that as you've noticed, I'm writing more here and hope you'll join in on the conversation. I also want to take this opportunity to urge you to write. Our industry thrives because there are always people willing to share what they learn and I hope you're having a part in that too.</p>

          <img src="/uploads/2012/06/welcome2MN.png" alt="Welcome to Minnesota" />

<p>This past week, I started a new era in my life. I finally made my move to the beautiful Land of 10,000 Lakes: Minnesota. Some of you who know me will remember that I've been here before. You're right! About two years ago (has it been that long?) I spent six months here and fell in love with the city and people. I had the chance to make some great friends and meet very creative people who are working on awesome things.</p>

<p>At the moment, I'm busy getting things setup and put away. It's crazy how much there is do to when you move. I've moved plenty of times so, naturally, I thought I'd be a pro. What I found out, is that nothing prepares you for a cross-country move. I will say though, what really helped out was <a href="http://middaylatte.com/post/6286592516/my-cross-country-move-orlando-to-san-francisco">this post</a> by Allison House. If you're making a big move, I really recommend you read it. It'll help you get organized and, really, for a move like this, that's the most important thing.</p>

<p>Anyway, now that I'm in Minnesota, I'm hoping to find a web design meetup to go to. If you have any suggestions, let me know! I also want to take this moment to give a huge thanks to <a href="https://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a> for being awesome and letting me move and work wherever I want. <a href="http://theeastwing.net">The East Wing</a> will be ramping up again this week with <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>. It's going to be a great episode!</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading! I'll see y'all on the internets!</p>

<p>As web designers, we work in a vibrant industry filled with lots of ideas and many who are great at voicing strong opinions. At least for me, it's easy to get sucked into trying to get everything right and wind up focusing on the wrong things.[...] if you want to be a great web designer, focusing on the specific tools you use within your workflow is really not that helpful. Rather, focusing on how to uncover problems, how to understand users, how the technology of your medium works, how to discover and emulate beauty, and how to enjoy your work are going to be far more beneficial to your long term success!

<p>I love this section from <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/team/jared-ponchot" target="_blank">Jared's</a> newest article. Really, his whole article on designing in the browser is spectacular and brings up some thought-provoking points. This is quite the hot topic in the industry at the moment and if you listen to The East Wing, you know I've voiced my opinion on this quite a few times. However, Jared does a great job in re-focusing all of us. He's right. The tools we use aren't what matters. At the end of the day, our effectiveness in discovering and solving problems within our work is what matters. It's a great read, I really recommend you check it out.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/the-state-of-instagram">The State of Instagram</a></h2>
          <p>Many people have been talking about Instagram lately, especially with the introduction of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mobile/camera" target="_blank">Facebook Camera</a>. My pal, <a href="http://blog.adellecharles.com/facebook-camera-instagram" target="_blank">Adelle Charles</a> wrote about it on her blog and she brings up some interesting points. I was also reading a new review of the app on iPhone Appstorm with the title being: <em>Instagram is Reborn as Facebook Camera</em>.</p>

<p>I am on my knees, begging that this isn't accurate. It's funny how worked up we can get over a simple app but, that's just it. It's not just an app. These companies become part of how we do things everyday and we live in a society where these more successful startups (Facebook, Twitter and Google) seem to be buying everything.</p> 

<p>Y'all remember Tweetie? Remember how absolutely beautiful it was? Remember how it was the best Twitter client and pioneered UI patterns that are still in use today? Then Twitter came in, bought it and eventually it became the crap it is today.</p> 

<p>I fear the same is happening to Instagram. I will gladly give you of my hard earned money if you make something awesome. In this case, I would've gladly payed for Instagram (This is the guy that downloaded the completely leaked Drake album and proceeded to pay for it when it came out a week later). I genuinely care for people that make things I like and if I could've had a part in Instagram not becoming part of Facebook's massive monopoly, that would've made me happy.</p>

<p>To those of you who are entrepreneurs and making new apps, charge from the beginning. If you make something of value, people will pay for it.</p>

<p>This is so exciting! I’m really looking forward to the release of the iPhone 5. I’m really happy about the larger screen size. However, I do have to say I’m a bit disappointed that the dock connector has been redesigned. If that turns out to be true, I think it’ll be a headache. A lot of us have multiple Apple products and up until now, they awesomely share the same charger. What do you think? Are you excited about the new iPhone?</p>

<p>I really liked this post on the Creative Bloq and I love <a href="http://www.sazzy.co.uk/">Sarah's</a> answer. The truth is, it's so easy to go around saying that an interface could be more polished. Personally, I'd love to see the amazing that Sarah would do with Facebook (would it be pink?). I, like most people, am not really happy with what's been happening with the Facebook UI. However, as Sarah points out, no one knows better than the designers that actually work there what the goals and purposes are behind the design decisions. In my humble opinion, that might be something we don't always agree with but must respect.</p>

          <p>I stumbled across this bad boy because of <a href="http://lukesbeard.com/" target="_blank">Luke Beard</a> and I can't wait to see how this will help my development process. Until now, I had tested a couple of different tools and so far, none of them really worked like I'd like them to. You should check this out and let me know if you like it.</p>

          <p>This particular episode of The East Wing is a special one. Not only was the conversation with Janna great, it was the first episode with Galen as my co-host. I really think y'all will love this new arrangement. He brings something special to the show with his opinions, great questions and "Galen's Topic of the Week". If you haven't already, I invite you to subscribe to the show. It's a great one.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/new-beginnings">New Beginnings</a></h2>
          <p>So as you may have noticed the site got a bit of a refresh. I've been working diligently on the new Lullabot.com and I was inspired to rethink my own site. I decided to finally treat my site as I would a client site (for the most part). Create a type of creative brief, wireframe key pages, and pay attention to the details of the site (i.e. textures, hover effects and, yes, an adaptive layout).</p>

<p>There were many things that bothered me about the old site and I've done my best to address them. Mostly, I had a problem with not only the display of content but, the creation of it as well. I'm the type to find interesting links all the time and often have small pieces I'd like to share. This design will make that easy. My pal <a href="http://galengidman.com/" target="_blank">Galen</a>, helped me create a post format for links. I'm so thankful for his help.</p>

<p>My larger pieces, however, will mostly live on the Lullabot blog. I'm so happy to be working there and I'm excited to be playing a role in the design team and in creating design related content together with my awesome teammate <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jponch" target="_blank">Jared Ponchot</a>. With that said, if I think of something that doesn't fit there, it will always have a home here.</p>

<p>As always, I'd appreciate any feedback and constructive criticism that you might have about the site. Thanks for reading and your continued support.</p>

<p>I wrote my first article on the Lullabot Blog! It's on Constructive Criticism. I find that this trend to publicly shame people about the work they're doing is wrong and isn't the way to make the web a better place. It's a quick read; something small you can digest during a break in your work day. Hope you enjoy!</p>

  <p>There's no need to sacrifice happiness for success. We believe that happiness, fun, and general silliness bring with them an energy which fuels creativity and innovation, creates a more open and communicative workplace, and makes for a more productive, more dedicated team. It's also just more fun. We try to focus on the positive and downplay competition and negativism. We are grateful for our successes and celebrate them.

<p>Isn't that awesome? I love the sound of that and I'm so happy and excited to now be working with <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/" target="_blank">Lullabot</a>. Lullabot is the world's top Drupal consulting and education company. They're responsible for creating websites for the <a href="http://www.grammy.com/" target="_blank">Grammy's</a>, <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/" target="_blank">Martha Stewart</a>, <a href="http://www.wwe.com/" target="_blank">WWE</a> and <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/services/clients" target="_blank">more</a>.</p>

<p>This means I'm no longer working at <a href="http://getworksimple.com" target="_blank">WorkSimple</a> and I'd like to take this time to thank the wonderful people there, for the opportunity to work with them. I learned so much from the team and I can't wait to see the great things they're in the process of releasing.</p>

<p>I'll also be attending my first conference: <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/" target="_blank">DrupalCon Denver</a>! I'll be tweeting and checking in like crazy and if you'll be there, <a href="/contact">let me know</a>! I'd love to meet ya!</p>

<p>As always, thank you for reading and your support! I'm excited about this new opportunity at Lullabot and look forward to the projects I'll be working on.</p>
