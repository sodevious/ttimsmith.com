        How much does a polar bear weigh? Just enough to break the ice.

          <p>Last week, I had the chance to sit down with Steve Derico and Sam Soffes. These two guys are behind one of my favorite podcasts: <a href="http://refactor.tv/">Refactor.Tv</a>. In the episode we talk about a variety of things. It was really fun to record. It feels more like you get to listen in to one of our conversations more than an actual interview.

          <h2><a href="/articles/my-definition-of-success">My Definition of Success</a></h2>
          <p>It's 2013. Another year has come and gone in what seems to be a blink of an eye. For me, it's been a bittersweet year full of mistakes and achievements. As I look back on 2012, I will forever remember it and its many ups and downs.</p>

<p>However, with a new year, comes a feeling of excitement; a feeling of starting anew, where we all begin at zero and where we have the hope to set and reach new goals. At least for me, the goals seem to be the same for every year: lose weight, get up earlier, etc.</p>

<p>Recently, I've had the time to think a lot about these goals and my life. My first reaction was to get upset and angry at myself for not accomplishing these seemingly simple goals. Yet, I've come to the realization that keeping hope and not giving up on these things are in and of itself a feat. I've realized that the effort says as much and maybe more about a person than the results.</p>

<p>It's only normal to think the other way though. We've grown up in a society that measures results; whether it be money, statistics or championships. What about the hard work behind these results? And the work of those that didn't reach them? Are their efforts of any less value? What about us?</p>

<p><strong>It makes no sense to measure our results by someone else's definition of success</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>This past year has been rough for me. I've made bad personal decisions, I quit a job that I loved and was fired from the one I quit for. I was left with no savings, a new apartment lease and a hefty car payment. All while being more than 1,600 miles away from my family in a place where below zero temperatures are normal during the winter.</p>

<p>For a while I was content with saying my life sucked and calling it a day. That's no longer the case. It goes against my nature to be this way. I'm an optimist and I know that things always find a way to work out. But, you've got to put in the work. I refuse to be of the people that are only happy when success is handed to them.</p>

<p>With that said, here are my goals for this year:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Lose Weight</strong><br />
Like I've said before, this is something I've been trying to do forever. I need to eat more vegetables, fruit and less sweets. I just got myself a gym membership too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pay Attention to the Relationships that Matter</strong><br />
I love my family. I love my friends. I need to spend more time with them. At the end of the day, these are the things that make you happy and that really matter in life.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speak on Design</strong><br />
I'd really like to speak more in 2013. I did one talk at my local meet up last year and it went great. I'd be a great speaker for any event. Don't believe me? <a href="http://theeastwing.net">Listen to my podcast</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Work Less</strong><br />
For many, this might seem like a dumb goal if you're trying to be successful but, again, who's definition are we measuring it to? I'd like to work just enough to pay my bills and use the rest of my time for other important things.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Travel More</strong><br />
I'm single and in the prime of my life. I need to get out of my apartment more and get back to exploring the world one cup of coffee at a time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So these are the goals I hope to accomplish in 2013. If I don't accomplish them all, there's always 2014. The point is to never give up on your goals, nor on yourself.</p>

<p>What about you? What do you want to accomplish?</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/sharing-is-caring">Sharing is Caring</a></h2>
          <p>Recently, I’ve been making an effort to have coffee or meet up with fellow designers and developers here in the Twin Cities. We have a very strong community of smart and creative people here so, I've been trying to get to know people individually. As you might know, I’m a coffee addict so, these meetings are a great way to feed the vice.</p>

<p>However, I’ve come across something extraordinary. In each of these coffee meetings, we always end up talking about something fascinating that the other person is working on and my question is always the same: “Why aren’t you writing about this?”.</p>

<p>I’ve realized that way too many people are shy about writing or documenting about their process and work. Interestingly, I talked about this with <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/37-brian">Brian Hoff on The East Wing</a> the other day. We talked about how helpful it was for him to start <a href="http://thedesigncubicle.com/">The Design Cubicle</a>. That blog has not only been a huge source of work for him; it's served countless times as a valuable resource for me and likely for many of you.</p>

<p>What would’ve happened if he hadn’t been keen on sharing? I think it's safe to say that his career would be completely different.</p>

<p>Let me tell you another story. I had the pleasure of going to <a href="http://frontenddesignconference.com/2012">The Front-End Design Conference</a> last June. Both <a href="http://daverupert.com/">Dave Rupert</a> and <a href="http://darcyclarke.me/">Darcy Clarke</a> clearly admonished people to share and blog more about what they were working on.</p>

<p><strong>I completely agree with this movement.</strong></p>

<p>You might be thinking, “Another blog? Would anyone even be interested in what I write?”. <strong>That doesn't matter.</strong> Let me give you a couple of reasons why you should be writing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Learn as you go</strong><br />
Do you think Chris Coyier knew what he was doing when he first started <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>? I bet you he didn’t. He was fascinated with what you could do with CSS and just wanted to share what he was learning along the way. In the process, he went from being a beginner to a very respected person in our industry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get work</strong><br />
Most of the work I’ve done, whether it be freelance or the full-time jobs I’ve been so fortunate to hold, have come about either through this blog or <a href="http://theeastwing.net/">The East Wing</a>. Employers and clients like people who are passionate about what they do and sharing things you’re learning is a great way to show that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strengthen Your Personal Brand</strong><br />
A lot of people want to write for the big blogs or publications to be recognized but, what they’re forgetting is their own brand. I think a great example of this <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>. You know him from his own personal writing place: Daring Fireball, not as the writer from another publication. He’s turned his name and brand into a very respected one.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what do you say? Will you throw embarrassment or the thoughts of not having enough experience to the wind and start your own blog? Will you start sharing what you’re working on and help others who may be trying to learn something similar?</p>

<p><strong>Do it.</strong></p>

<p>Earlier last week, 6Wunderkinder released the new <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist">Wunderlist 2</a>. I had never used any of their products before but, I'm so glad I finally did.

          <p>I'll be honest, I loved the <a href="http://5by5.tv/specials/10">State of the Union Address</a> that Dan Benjamin did on 5by5. It was so personal and I think that's why so many people love Dan. I had been thinking of doing something similar to thank everyone listening to The East Wing in our first year.</p>

<p>I can't believe how quick these past 10 months have gone and the huge support we've received. For me, a person that doesn't have thousands of followers, it's amazed me to see the number of listeners rapidly increase every week.</p>

<p>You should <a href="http://theeastwing.net/episodes/2012-eya">take a listen</a>. It'll take two minutes of your time.</p>

          <p>It’s always bothered me that girls are brought up thinking they’re princesses. I feel like it’s a huge lie. Being a princess isn’t an actual job you can achieve and isn’t real life. The truth is, women don’t dress up in gowns everyday and “Prince Charming” only exists in books. Girls can grow up to be so much more.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/goldieblox">Debbie Lewis</a> knows this and wanted to create a toy that would stimulate an interest in science and engineering for girls. It's called GoldieBlox. I admire what she’s doing and I’m glad she’s doing it. Find out more about the toy <a href="http://www.upworthy.com/move-over-barbie-8212-youre-obsolete">here</a>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/latest-news-updates">Latest News &amp; Updates</a></h2>
          <p>I'd like to start off by announcing that as of yesterday I started as the Director of Design for <a href="http://rocketlift.com">Rocket Lift Inc</a>. I've been working on client projects with these guys for about two months now and I've come to really like them. They're a fun team, we say things that HR reps have nightmares about and we have big plans of what we'd like to do together. Also, <a href="http://twitter.com/mattepp">Matt Eppelsheimer</a> is very well aware of my other projects and is giving me time to work on them and for that, I'm very thankful.</p>

<p>In the upcoming months, I'm looking forward to the projects we have in the pipeline and also being part of positioning ourselves to do some really exciting things with WordPress. We're overhauling the branding of the company and the website will receive a much needed re-design. Again, I can't tell you how excited I am to be part of all this.</p>

<h3>The East Wing</h3>

<p>My podcast continues strong and I'm amazed that I'll be publishing episode thirty-five this week. I've had an amazing year with the show. I've talked to some very smart people, people whom I've been following for years and can now call friends. Stay tuned for full update a on The East Wing coming out in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<h3>Make Awesome</h3>

<p>First of all, thank you to the many who supported and backed this project with their hard earned money. I'm so thankful to you. The Kickstarter campaign did fail but, it's not the end of this idea. I'm currently talking to companies interested in sponsoring the magazine and I've found a local printer who will print the magazine for a significantly lower price. This is great for two reasons. First, the reduced cost will make the magazine affordable for more people and second, we'll be able to say the magazine was created in Minnesota. We have such an amazing community here and it'll be exciting to see one more thing that was completely made here.</p>

<p>Also, in the next couple of weeks, Make Awesome will resurface with an all new name. I'm renaming the magazine because a very popular designer, Leslie Jensen-Inman, had started doing things under <a href="http://www.makeawesomeness.com/">Make Awesomeness</a>. I had no idea of this when I named the magazine. Since we haven't published an issue yet, I want to change the name in good faith and not interfere with anything she might be doing. What's the new name? You'll have to <a href="http://makeaweso.me/">subscribe to the newsletter</a> to find out.</p>

<h3>Browser Tap</h3>

<p>This is a project I'm very excited about. <a href="http://twitter.com/craigcondon">Craig Condon</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tim_erickson">Tim Erickson</a> and myself have been working on an app that will make cross-browser testing so much easier than it is right now. We've rethought the way it's done and hopefully made an application that will fit into your workflow instead of you having to accommodate to an application. Craig is a genius and has been doing some amazing things from the technical side. We hope to start sending out beta invites very soon. If you want to stay updated, <a href="http://twitter.com/browsertap">follow @browsertap</a> on Twitter.</p>

<h3>So Much More</h3>

<p>Quite honestly, there is so much more I'm planning on doing. <a href="http://twitter.com/mattsteeele">Matt Steele</a> will tell you. I want to get more involved here in the Twin Cities community. Maybe organize a meet up. Maybe even a conference. The days of me sitting around and seeing other people do all this awesome stuff are gone. I want to do things I have a passion for. I'm going to make stuff because I want to see it exist and I'm going to have fun doing it.</p>

<p>The end of this year puts an end to an extremely bittersweet time. I've made great decisions and horrible ones; some of which I'll regret for a very long time. But, life isn't about sulking about the things that happen to you or the stupid things you decide to do, it's about learning, moving on and making things better. 2013 is my year.</p>

          <p>Last week, I received an awesome email from David Silverman, a ninth grader that has interviewed some of the best in our industry on InstantBight. How I made it on that list, I don't know. However, I'm very happy and honored to be on it.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/connecting-less">Connecting Less</a></h2>
          <p>I started an experiment today. I removed email from my phone. This isn't a huge deal but, I'm going to try it for a whole week and see where I'm at after that. I decided to do this because I feel to plugged in all the time. I'm constantly worrying if a client has sent me something I should get to or if someone has sent me a message offering me a lot of money (haha yea right).</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>I was watching Parks and Recreation (you should watch it too if you're not) the other day and I noticed that even though I had finished work, I was constantly checking my email.</p>

<p>I've noticed that ever since I started freelancing, I respect my personal time less. I'm always on and I hate that. At least for me, I'm not liking the unbalanced balance I'm striking here. As much as my clients might not like it, I shouldn't be available past 5pm Central Time. Anything that happens after that can wait till the next morning. Of course, there are some exceptions but for the most part, it can wait.</p>

<p>I'll always remember something my Dad tells me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You've got to look out for yourself because no one else is going to do it for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As sad as that is, it's true. If people know they can get you to do things for free, they will. If they know you're reachable at night for “project emergencies”, they will take advantage of that. Of course, I think it's essential to be respectful when establishing these limits and I've seen that when I set them early, things go so much smoother.</p>

<p>So, in an effort to keep the balance a bit better and enjoy life more, I'm eliminating email from my phone. In the world we live in, with everything being instant and people becoming less patient, I think it's important to disconnect and enjoy the things away from the desk.</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/freelancing-what-ive-learned">Freelancing: What I’ve Learned</a></h2>
          <p>It's been 36 days since I began freelancing again. This time around, it's going a lot smoother and I've seen the practicality of working at companies and design agencies. I've had the privilege of working with some very smart people who thankfully have taken the time to impart some of their wisdom with me.</p>

<p>Many have labeled <a href="http://www.andyrutledge.com/advice-for-new-freelancers.php">Andy Rutledge</a> as a jerk for his advice on freelancing. Although I don't agree with him completely, I do see the value of his words now.</p>

<p>As I operate my business day to day, I'm noticing that I've become significantly better at a lot of things. However, like with everything, there are aspects that I'm still trying to get better at. This post is to look at the things I feel I'm doing right and others that, well, not so much.</p>

<h3>Shower When You Wake Up</h3>

<p>This sounds like an obvious one but, it's not. There are some people that shower every other day. For me, I shower everyday. When I worked full-time, I'd always shower at night.</p>

<p>I've seen a huge increase in my productivity when I shower in the mornings. Especially since I work from home, it could become to easy to roll out of bed and immediately sit down at my desk. In contrast, a good shower makes me feel fresh, awake and ready to get to work. I've only been doing this recently but, I've noticed that when I do, I feel really good about the day.</p>

<h3>Don’t Eat Junk Food</h3>

<p>This is one I haven't been doing so well. I've noticed an increase in my weight since I began freelancing because I'm not as cautious of the food I'm consuming. Junk food is not only bad for your health but, I've noticed that it makes me feel crappy about myself. Low self-esteem is no good for a designer or, therefore, anyone.</p>

<p>Recently, I've made a bigger effort to buy vegetables and fruit. I'm a big fan of apples and oranges which are great for you. Apples have some great antioxidants on the outside and are yummy. Oranges have a good dose of Vitamin C and I've noticed that when I make a habit of eating them, I get sick a lot less.</p>

<h3>Wake Up A Bit Earlier</h3>

<p>Another one I haven't been great at but, getting better. My sleep schedule had me going to sleep at 2am and waking up at 11am (way past McDonalds breakfast. Doh! See last point). What would happen is I'd finish my normal work day around 8 or 9pm. For me this was really bad. I felt tired all the time and even though I was getting up late, I still felt I wasn't getting enough sleep.</p>

<p>This week, I decided to always be in bed by 12 and wake up at 8 and it's made a huge difference. I feel rested and ready to kick the day's butt. I also get coffee earlier and am suitably caffeinated for my commitments.</p>

<h3>Better Business Practices</h3>

<p><strong>Consult with an accountant!</strong> Do it! This is one of the biggest mistakes I made last time around. An accountant can help you figure out what type of entity you want to be and the proper procedures around quarterly tax payments. Use something like <a href="http://outright.com/">OutRight</a>. They make it easy to import your account and then categorize your expenses.</p>

<p><strong>No Scope Creep</strong> I had the tendency to price projects at a flat rate. When you sign a contract for a final payment of $5k, that's great, until you realize you invested about $6k in time. Bill hourly and make sure the complete scope of the project is in the contract! (Wait, don't have a contract? Get one!) Make it clear that any work beyond the scope will be billed at the hourly rate and to make sure, get all of those requests in writing so that you can prove they approved this extra work.</p>

<p><strong>Have a Contract</strong> This is necessary for any freelancer. I whole heartedly agree with <a href="http://muledesign.com/about/mike-monteiro/">Mike Monteiro</a> on this one. When asked when it's time to get a lawyer he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you want to stop being a design amateur and be a design professional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, as my next point will state, having a steady cash flow is one of the hardest things to create. So, with that in mind, I suggest you take a look at <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/contract_killer_the_next_hit/">Andy Clarke's</a> thoughts on this. He wrote up a very good contract that I still use for all of my clients.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Steady Cash Flow</strong> I talk about this as something I seriously need to get better at. At the moment, I feel like I'm living too tight. As much as I've tried to keep my expenses down, I was used to a nice full-time salary. Although some offers do come through, not all of them turn into business.</p>

<p>For this point, I turn to you. What have you done to make this better? How do you go about saving money?</p>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>Well, I think that's it for now. There is so much to share but, I think small doses are better. Is there something I missed? Or something you'd like to read more about? Let me know and I'll do my best to write about it.</p>
