          <h2><a href="/articles/thoughts-on-designing-for-emotion">Thoughts on Designing for Emotion</a></h2>
          <img src="/uploads/2012/02/emotionpic1.jpg" alt="Designin for Emotion">
<p>I'm a firm believer that the day you stop learning is the day you die. I'd describe myself as a self starter, always looking for new things to learn and existing skills that need refinement. Since I still have lots to live (hopefully), I also have lots to learn.</p>

<p>I went to college for about two years yet, I didn't learn as much as I would've liked or even what I needed to learn. Therefore, I'm mostly self taught. I've spent countless, non-billable hours, experimenting with HTML, CSS and other design and dev personal projects, in an effort to better myself and improve my craft.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's quite a big intro into the real topic of this post. I'd like to give my thoughts on <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion" target="_blank">Designing for Emotion</a> by <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/" target="_blank">Aarron Walter</a>.</p>

<p>Let's start off by saying that it's absolutely awesome. If you've read the other books that <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/" target="_blank">A Book Apart</a> has published, you'd expect nothing less so, let me convince you why.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The content of this book is great. Aarron know's what he's talking about and that comes across every sentence you read. The extensive research is evident and each statement, study and example convince you more that this is the right way of designing for the web.</p>

<p>After reading this book, as with a lot of the different articles I read, I realize how much I still have to learn and put into practice. For me, it's exciting to see how I can improve and quickly implement these techniques into my work.</p>

<p>The prevalent theme is to inject personality into a website. Aarron emphasizes that a website is human too and offers logical ways to make this happen. Designing personas is an amazing idea and just one of many practical tips he offers. Anyone working on a product needs to read this. It's guaranteed to bring the level of work you produce to the next level.</p>

<p>Something interesting to note about this book is the constant studies of psychology and the human brain. This was especially helpful as many of the studies are something I would've never imagined to research and have really helped me understand how we, as humans, respond and react to design. Aarron explains that we make decisions on emotion not logic; interestingly, making designing for emotion such a logical choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surprise is always followed by a proportional emotional response[...] There's not enough time for deep, intellectual contemplation, so the brain relies on emotion to provide a "gut reaction."
<small>Aarron Walter, Designing For Emotion</small></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Tone</h3>
<p>What I love about <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/" target="_blank">A Book Apart</a> is the tone of the books published. I've read the other books in the collection and it's easy to recognize the way that they want the reader to feel when reading these books.</p>

<p>Aarron's writing style is witty and humorous in all the right places and he is able to explain complex design theory in terms that are understandable and easily applicable. I found myself laughing quite a few times and having lots of "Aha!" moments. He talks about reverse mullets and how that relates to design: party in the front, business in the back. C'mon now, that's hilarious.</p>

<p>It's truly amazing how Aarron not only is able to communicate excellently on these principles but, also putting them into practice in the book itself. The book is designed for emotional response, engaging you every step of the way and urging you to read more.</p>

<p>I want to extend a personal thank you to Aarron. Thank you for writing this book and thank you for helping me do my job better. I owe him much more than what I paid for this book. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.</p>

          <p class="pubdate">February 13, 2012</p>
          <h2><a href="/articles/apps-i-love-mac-edition">Apps I Love (Mac Edition)</a></h2>
          <p>Every once in a while, I get asked for app recommendations. I love giving these type of recommendations and if you follow me on twitter, you'll notice that I often ask for them too. Finding and using new apps is fun for me and I'm always looking for better and simpler ways of doing things. With that said, I thought I'd publish a list of some of my favorite apps in the hope of helping out some new Mac owners or point you to something you didn't know about before. You'll notice that the title of the post is "Mac Edition" which hints at a series!</p>

<p>Just as a side note, these apps are in no particular order. I use most of these everyday and would be at a total loss without them (which is sad). Also, I'm not using any affliate links and I wasn't paid to talk about any of these apps.</p>

<h3><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/" target="_blank">Text Expander</a></h3>
<p>If you don't have Text Expander, you really need to get on this bandwagon. It's an amazing app that saves me so much time everyday. I've programmed snippets that I use on a daily basis like my different email signatures, code snippets, my phone number, resume, etc. I save about an hour and a half of typing everyday; to me that's enough to make it's price of $34.95 worth it.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.rdio.com/" target="_blank">Rdio</a></h3>
<p>I was a little late to this party but, Wow! I'm loving it. I just bought my subscription the other day and have found it extremely useful. I am at my desk most of the day and like any normal person, I love music. I've found most or all of my favorite music and the stream is excellent. I love it because, there's always new music, playlists or friends stations that I can listen to. Also, iTunes is so bloated these days and it always runs super slow on my machine. Great alternative and beautiful UI.</p>

<h3><a href="http://macromates.com/" target="_blank">TextMate</a></h3>
<p>I was using Smultron in my amateur days and as I look back, I don't know how I ever made do with it. I love TextMate. The themes that are included are great and it's features are very useful. I'm no expert and I'm learning new features of the app all the time but, the one I have discovered like, bundles, line collapse and others have made this app just amazing to use. The great thing is, you can add more functionality too! If you're writing SCSS, you can find extentions to properly color the code.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.iawriter.com/" target="_blank">iA Writer</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely love this app. I wrote this post in iA Writer. It's such a beautiful app with such a simple interface; it's hard not to like it. I do have to credit <a href="http://adellecharles.com/" target="_blank">Adelle</a> for pointing me to this app and I'm glad she did. What I love about it is the seamless integration with iCloud. I can be working on a document on my Mac and then move to the couch and work on it from my iPad. Also, no formatting! The truth is, formatting takes up time and space and you don't need it to write. Writer does this excellently.</p>

<h3><a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com/" target="_blank">Sparrow</a></h3>
<p>This is actually a new app I just got into. I had heard such great things about it for a while. However, I didn't have my email set up with Google so, I hadn't moved over. What a mistake! I was using Postbox and although I was a loyal user for about two years, their app is a bit bloated and slows down my machine quite a bit. I run four different email accounts and not being able to switch between these effortlessly through out the day is a big downer. I'm now proud to say I'm using Sparrow and I love it. Beautiful UI, you can feel the attention to detail and very lightweight.</p>

<h3><a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/" target="_blank">Reeder</a></h3>
<p>For the longest time, I was using my email to receive RSS feeds. Big mistake. Not only did it clutter my inbox but, I would tend to delete articles in an effort of bringing my inbox to zero. It was an absolute mess and I wasn't reading like I would want to. Reeder is an excellent solution for me. I've added all or most of my feeds over to Reeder and now enjoy some reading before starting the work day. It's integration with Readability make the app that more useful. I can go through the day and bookmark an article in Readability knowing that it'll be there, waiting for me in Reeder.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.getharvest.com/mac" target="_blank">Harvest</a></h3>
<p>Every contractor needs this. Actually, even if you're not a contractor, you need this. Harvest is actually a web app but, since I use the Mac App, I'll include it into this list. Harvest has simplified my life in so many ways. I can keep track of my time, easily sumbit invoices and provide estimates and it keeps track of my monthly and yearly earnings, making tax time that much easier.</p>

<h3><a href="http://getcloudapp.com/" target="_blank">Cloud App</a></h3>
<p>This app is amazing! I use this everyday. Yet, I believe I only use half of it's great features. I use it's Photoshop and Chrome raindrops the most. Through out the day, I'll be working on a comp and can easily upload my work and send it for feedback. Not to mention, it's a great way for me to see the progress I make on a certain interface. Also, when I go to share useful links on Twitter, I use CloudApp to shorten them. It also has Sparrow integration, allowing me to send lightweight emails with attachments in the cloud.</p>

<h3><a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/" target="_blank">Audio Hijack Pro</a></h3>
<p>Let's make it clear from the beginning, I love this app because of the functionality not because of the design. If you have a better alternative, please let me know. It's a great app though. I use it to record the audio from Skype which is really useful when recording episodes for the podcasts I host. You can record any audio really. However, my critique about this app is it's usability. It was a bit difficult to figure out how to use the first time but, thanks to <a href="http://nikibrown.com/" target="_blank">Niki</a>, I was able to set up a bit quicker.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html" target="_blank">MAMP</a></h3>
<p>Last but definitely not least, MAMP. If you're writing PHP or developing Wordpress themes, you need this. Setting up is quite easy but, if you need some help, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/86-mamp/" target="_blank">watch this great video</a> by Chris Coyier. I always love the way he teaches, it's so personal. Love that. I owe him for a lot of the things I know now. Anyway, this isn't about Chris, it's about MAMP. It's a great app that will allow you to work locally which is good practice. I know most of us will work directly on the server and refresh but, you'll notice quickly this isn't the right way of doing things when you break everything because of an incorrectly placed "=" sign. Work locally with MAMP and then push up to your server. A lot easier and faster.</p>

<p>And that's my list of apps I love! If you have any recommendations or suggestions of better apps, let me know! I'd love to hear about them!</p>

          <h2><a href="/articles/here-the-latest">Hereâs the Latest</a></h2>
          <p>This Saturday, I finally decided it was time to get serious about my sites and actually host them somewhere reliable. I'm happy to say that my three awesome sites (<a href="http://laughifyouwanttoo.com" target="_blank">Laugh If You Want Too</a>, <a href="http://theeastwing.net" target="_blank">The East Wing</a> and this one) are now hosted with the very trust worthy <a href="http://mediatemple.net/" target="_blank">Media Temple</a>. I'm not getting paid for advertising them, I've just really liked the service so far. The hosting is a major upgrade from what I had before and it's very affordable. At the time of writing this, their Grid Service is only $20/month. That's not bad, not bad at all.</p>

<p>I'd also like to give my sincerest thank you to Chris Coyier from CSS-Tricks for <a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/46-domains-dns-hosting-and-google-apps/" target="_blank">this screencast</a>. He goes into detail on how to move a domain's DNS to point to Media Temple and how to setup email with Google Apps. It only took me a couple of hours to move everything and get the sites up and running. Real time saver!</p>

<h3>I Have a Job</h3>
<p>I'm really excited to announce that I'm now happily pushing pixels at <a href="http://getworksimple.com" target="_blank">WorkSimple, Inc.</a> I found them in late December via <a href="http://www.authenticjobs.com/" target="_blank">Authentic Jobs</a> and really fell in love with the company and the product. I've been working with them a couple days shy of a month now and it's been an awesome ride. The work I've been involved with has been really challenging and exciting and I also have the privilege of working with a great team that I'm learning a lot from.</p>

<p>For example, this week I'm learning HAML and SCSS. If you haven't looked into it, it's revolutionary. It'll change the way you code forever. Now, I might be late to the party on this one but, I was completely geeking out the other day when <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kenearley" target="_blank">Ken</a>, one of our front-end devs, was giving me a crash course. I owe him tons of money now for allowing me to pick his brain. I highly recommend reading <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/getting-started-with-sass/" target="_blank">this article</a> if you're interested in Sass. I'm telling you, it's absolutely revolutionary.</p>

<h3>The East Wing</h3>
<p>People, keep an eye out for <a href="http://theeastwing.net" target="_blank">The East Wing</a>. Things are really revving up for this. I'm really excited and hope you are too. At the moment we have guests lined up for Episodes 1-5 and trust me, we'll be talking to some awesome people, like <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/benmoore" target="_blank">Ben Moore</a>, <a href="http://kennedysgarage.com/" target="_blank">Chris Kennedy</a>, <a href="http://nikibrown.com/" target="_blank">Niki Brown</a> and <a href="http://zerply.com/justinstyle/" target="_blank">Justin Style</a>, just to name a few. It'd be a real shame for you to miss out on this so, head on over to the website and sign up for our newsletter. We'll be launching February 15th so, put it in your calendars!</p>

<p>If you're interested on being on the show and you're working on an interesting product or project, email us at <a href="mailto:hello@theeastwing.net">hello@theeastwing.net</a> and I promise to respond as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As always, thank you for reading and if you have thoughts you'd like to share, give me a shout on <a href="http://twitter.com/timothybsmith" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

    <article class="entry">
      <div class="contain">   
        
          <p class="pubdate">January  9, 2012</p>
          <h2><a href="/articles/fresh-new-look">Fresh New Look!</a></h2>
          <p>So, Iâve got a brand new site... again. It almost seems that Iâm redesigning this crap too much. But, the truth is, there are always better ways to solve problems and I strive to do that with all of my work, even my personal stuff. With that said, the site I had up before honestly looked a bit amateurish. I donât know what I was thinking. I mean, it did only take about two hours to design and code it up so, that might explain things a bit. Either way, moving forward, there were a couple of things I wanted to get better at.</p>

<h3>My Work</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of work that Iâve done is restricted by NDAâs and thatâs all great when youâre working on these exciting projects but, when it comes time to display them, itâs horrible. Therefore, at the moment I can only show snippets of my work for which <a href="http://dribbble.com/timothybsmith" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> has been super useful. For now, that wonât change. But the truth is though, my design isnât the only thing Iâm working on at the moment. I have a pretty cool podcast called <a href="http://laughifyouwanttoo.com" target="_blank">Laugh If You Want Too</a> and a soon to be podcast called <a href="http://theeastwing.net" target="_blank">The East Wing</a> which is going to be awesome.</p>

<p>Having said that, I wanted this new design to give people the opportunity to see all of my stuff. I know Iâm no internet celebrity but, if youâre interested, now you can find it. Which reminds me &lt;rant&gt; Iâm no internet celebrity and I probably will never be but, why canât people reply to tweets of us unknown peeps? I donât get it. Maybe youâre too busy or you donât care for the people that admire your work. Who knows. One thing is true though, if you want to talk and interact with me, Iâll always reply. To know who you are, you gotta know where you came from. &lt;/rant&gt;</p>

<h3>Writing Again</h3>

<p>Iâm happy to report that my writing juices seem to be flowing again which is why I dedicated more time to the design of this site. I want to have somewhere to pour some of my thoughts. As I grow as a designer and a person, I find it essential to share the small bits of wisdom you find along the way. Again, it may not be a lot; I still have much to learn in design and in life but, Iâll always be thankful to those that helped me when I was starting out. Itâs about time I pay that forward.</p>

<h3>Thank You</h3>

<p>I just want to extend a huge thank you to those whom have supported me and have been interested in the different things I do. I also want to extend a thank you to <a href="http://www.andytlr.com/" target="_blank">Andy Taylor</a>, the creator of the <a href="http://cssgrid.net/" target="_blank">1140px CSS Grid</a>; itâs the reason why making this site responsive was a cinch! Check it out if you havenât already! Also, I big thank you to <a href="http://kennedysgarage.com/" target="_blank">Kennedy</a>, who took me out of a bind and helped me figure out how to change the color of a placeholder in a form.</p>

<p>Also, youâll notice that this blog is proudly brought to you by <a href="carbonads.net" target="_blank">Carbon Ads</a>. Adelle and her team are awesome and always on the look out for great companies for their network. Do yourself a favor and click on some of these ads. Yes, youâd be helping me make some money, but youâd be getting in some awesome products as well.</p>

<p>As always, thank you for reading and if you have thoughts youâd like to share, give me a shout on <a href="http://twitter.com/timothybsmith" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
