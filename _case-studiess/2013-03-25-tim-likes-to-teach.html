<p>Tim Likes to Teach is a personal project of mine, as well as my first product. Through this website, I sell screencasts which teach other people about web design, front-end development, WordPress, Git, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>The site called for a payment processing system, as well as a way to deliver files. I decided to go with <a href="http://memberful.com/">Memberful</a> which easily integrates with WordPress, and allows me to give exclusive access to people who buy the courses. I'm very happy with the result, and I'm so thankful to those who've purchased the first course.</p>

<p>You can read more on this project <a href="http://timothybsmith.com/links/my-first-product-launches">here</a>.</p>
