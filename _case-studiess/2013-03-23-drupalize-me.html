<p>While working at <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/">Lullabot</a>, I was also put on the Drupalize.Me project. Drupalize.Me is a product created by Lullabot in an effort to teach people <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>.</p>

<p>Drupal is a complex, yet very powerful content management system. Some of the biggest sites on the internet are powered by Drupal. Sites like <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">whitehouse.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.grammy.com/">grammy.com</a> and more are all made with Drupal.</p>

<p>However, as with most things that are powerful, Drupal can have a steep learning curve, leaving many beginners wondering where to start. That's where Drupalize.Me comes in. Boasting a catalog of more than 242 hours of Drupal training, many attribute their Drupal skills to this great site.</p>

<p>With the direction of <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/about/team/jared-ponchot">Jared Ponchot</a>, I took care of many design tasks that were needed and I also had the privilege of leading the redesign of this great resource.</p>

<p>You can read more about my process and work on the redesign, <a href="http://drupalize.me/blog/201207/giving-drupalizeme-new-coat-paint">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> The redesign is currently in development.</p>
