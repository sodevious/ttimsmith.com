<p>Bundly was an online experience company. They were a small start-up company founded in Minneapolis, MN. They had done user testing which indicated that the product might be useful but, the design needed significant improvement. I was brought in as Co-Founder and Lead Designer.</p>

<h3>User Experience</h3>

<p>This is where we spent a lot of time. We wanted to simplify the flows of the application as much as possible. It was a lot of fun to actually remove parts of the application that weren't really needed.</p>

<h3>Visual Aesthetic</h3>

<p>From the beginning, it was clear they wanted the main color to be blue. With that in mind, I created a color palette around the blue that complimented each other.</p>

<p>I also wanted to find a typeface that would work at text and display sizes. I chose to use <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Sans">Droid Sans</a> because of it's readable qualities and to stay within budget for the project.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>For me, this project was a delight. Working with the Bundly founding team was very rewarding and I'm so grateful to them for including me in this great experience.</p>
